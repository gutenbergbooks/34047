right bank of the Aous, founded by the Corinthians and Corcyraeans.
It soon became a place of increasing commercial
prosperity, as the most convenient link between Brundusium
and northern Greece, and as one of the starting-points of the
Via Egnatia. It was an important military post in the wars
against Philip and during the civil wars of Pompey and Caesar,
and towards the close of the Roman republic acquired fame as a
seat of literature and philosophy. Here Augustus was being
educated when the death of Caesar called him to Rome. It
seems to have sunk with the rise of Aulon, and few remains of its
ruins are to be found. The monastery of Pollina stands on a hill
which probably is part of the site of the old city. (2) A Thracian

Apollo by Calamis, which Lucullus removed to Rome.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APOLLONIUS OF PERGA<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Pergaeus</span>], Greek geometer of the
Alexandrian school, was probably born some twenty-five years
later than Archimedes, <i>i.e.</i> about 262 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He flourished in the
reigns of Ptolemy Euergetes and Ptolemy Philopator (247-205
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>). His treatise on <i>Conics</i> gained him the title of The Great
Geometer, and is that by which his fame has been transmitted
to modern times. All his numerous other treatises have perished,
save one, and we have only their titles handed down, with general
indications of their contents, by later writers, especially Pappus.
After the <i>Conics</i> in eight Books had been written in a first edition,
Apollonius brought out a second edition, considerably revised as
regards Books i.-ii., at the instance of one Eudemus of Pergamum;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span>
the first three books were sent to Eudemus at intervals, as revised,
and the later books were dedicated (after Eudemus&rsquo;
death) to King Attalus I. (241-197 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). Only four Books have
survived in Greek; three more are extant in Arabic; the eighth
has never been found. Although a fragment has been found of a
Latin translation from the Arabic made in the 13th century, it
was not until 1661 that a Latin translation of Books v.-vii.
was available. This was made by Giovanni Alfonso Borelli and
Abraham Ecchellensis from the free version in Arabic made in
983 by Abu &rsquo;l-Fath of Ispahan and preserved in a Florence MS.
But the best Arabic translation is that made as regards Books
i.-iv. by Hilal ibn Abi Hilal (d. about 883), and as regards Books
v.-vii. by Tobit ben Korra (836-901). Halley used for his
translation an Oxford MS. of this translation of Books v.-vii.,
but the best MS. (Bodl. 943) he only referred to in order to
correct his translation, and it is still unpublished except for a
fragment of Book v. published by L. Nix with German translation
(Drugulin, Leipzig, 1889). Halley added in his edition (1710)
a restoration of Book viii., in which he was guided by the fact
that Pappus gives lemmas &ldquo;to the seventh and eighth books&rdquo;
under that one heading, as well as by the statement of Apollonius
himself that the use of the seventh book was illustrated by the
problems solved in the eighth.</p>

<p>The degree of originality of the <i>Conics</i> can best be judged
from Apollonius&rsquo; own prefaces. Books i.-iv. form an &ldquo;elementary
introduction,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> contain the essential principles; the
rest are specialized investigations in particular directions. For
Books i.-iv. he claims only that the generation of the curves
and their fundamental properties in Book i. are worked out
more fully and generally than they were in earlier treatises, and
that a number of theorems in Book iii. and the greater part of
Book iv. are new. That he made the fullest use of his predecessors&rsquo;
works, such as Euclid&rsquo;s four Books on Conics, is clear
from his allusions to Euclid, Conon and Nicoteles. The generality
of treatment is indeed remarkable; he gives as the fundamental
property of all the conics the equivalent of the Cartesian
equation referred to <i>oblique</i> axes (consisting of a diameter and
the tangent at its extremity) obtained by cutting an oblique
circular cone in any manner, and the axes appear only as a
particular case after he has shown that the property of the conic
can be expressed in the same form with reference to any new
diameter and the tangent at its extremity. It is clearly the form
of the fundamental property (expressed in the terminology of
the &ldquo;application of areas&rdquo;) which led him to call the curves for
the first time by the names <i>parabola</i>, <i>ellipse</i>, <i>hyperbola</i>. Books
v.-vii. are clearly original. Apollonius&rsquo; genius takes its highest
flight in Book v., where he treats of normals as minimum and
maximum straight lines drawn from given points to the curve
(independently of tangent properties), discusses how many
normals can be drawn from particular points, finds their feet by
construction, and gives propositions determining the centre of
curvature at any point and leading at once to the Cartesian
equation of the evolute of any conic.</p>

<p>The other treatises of Apollonius mentioned by Pappus are&mdash;1st,
<span class="grk" title="Logou apotomae">&#923;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#965; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#942;</span>, <i>Cutting off a Ratio</i>; 2nd, <span class="grk" title="Choriou apotomae">&#935;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#942;</span>,
<i>Cutting of an Area</i>; 3rd, <span class="grk" title="Diorismenae tomae">&#916;&#953;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951; &#964;&#959;&#956;&#942;</span>, <i>Determinate Section</i>;
4th, <span class="grk" title="Epaphai">&#904;&#960;&#945;&#966;&#945;&#943;</span>, <i>Tangencies</i>; 5th, <span class="grk" title="Neuseis">&#925;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>, <i>Inclinations</i>; 6th, <span class="grk" title="Topoi
epipedoi">&#932;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#953; &#7952;&#960;&#943;&#960;&#949;&#948;&#959;&#953;</span>, <i>Plane Loci</i>. Each of these was divided into two books,
and, with the <i>Data</i>, the <i>Porisms</i> and <i>Surface-Loci</i> of Euclid and
the <i>Conics</i> of Apollonius were, according to Pappus, included in
the body of the ancient analysis.</p>

<p>1st. <i>De Rationis Sectione</i> had for its subject the resolution of
the following problem: Given two straight lines and a point in
each, to draw through a third given point a straight line cutting
the two fixed lines, so that the parts intercepted between the
given points in them and the points of intersection with this
third line may have a given ratio.</p>

<p>2nd. <i>De Spatii Sectione</i> discussed the similar problem which
requires the rectangle contained by the two intercepts to be equal
to a given rectangle.</p>

<p>An Arabic version of the first was found towards the end of
the 17th century in the Bodleian library by Dr Edward Bernard,
who began a translation of it; Halley finished it and published
it along with a restoration of the second treatise in 1706.</p>

<p>3rd. <i>De Sectione Determinata</i> resolved the problem: Given
two, three or four points on a straight line, to find another point
on it such that its distances from the given points satisfy the
condition that the square on one or the rectangle contained by
two has to the square on the remaining one or the rectangle
contained by the remaining two, or to the rectangle contained
by the remaining one and another given straight line, a given
ratio. Several restorations of the solution have been attempted,
one by W. Snellius (Leiden, 1698), another by Alex. Anderson of
Aberdeen, in the supplement to his <i>Apollonius Redivivus</i> (Paris,
1612), but by far the best is by Robert Simson, <i>Opera quaedam
reliqua</i> (Glasgow, 1776).</p>

<p>4th. <i>De Tactionibus</i> embraced the following general problem:
Given three things (points, straight lines or circles) in position,
to describe a circle passing through the given points, and touching
the given straight lines or circles. The most difficult case, and
the most interesting from its historical associations, is when the
three given things are circles. This problem, which is sometimes
known as the Apollonian Problem, was proposed by Vieta in the
16th century to Adrianus Romanus, who gave a solution by
means of a hyperbola. Vieta thereupon proposed a simpler
construction, and restored the whole treatise of Apollonius in a
small work, which he entitled <i>Apollonius Gallus</i> (Paris, 1600).
A very full and interesting historical account of the problem is
given in the preface to a small work of J.W. Camerer, entitled
<i>Apollonii Pergaei quae supersunt, ac maxime Lemmata Pappi in
hos Libras, cum Observationibus, &amp;c</i>. (Gothae, 1795, 8vo).</p>

<p>5th. <i>De Inclinationibus</i> had for its object to insert a straight
line of a given length, tending towards a given point, between
two given (straight or circular) lines. Restorations have been
given by Marino Ghetaldi, by Hugo d&rsquo;Omerique (<i>Geometrical
Analysis</i>, Cadiz, 1698), and (the best) by Samuel Horsley (1770).</p>

<p>6th. <i>De Locis Planis</i> is a collection of propositions relating to
loci which are either straight lines or circles. Pappus gives
somewhat full particulars of the propositions, and restorations
were attempted by P. Fermat (<i>Oeuvres</i>, i., 1891, pp. 3-51), F.
Schooten (Leiden, 1656) and, most successfully of all, by R.
Simson (Glasgow, 1749).</p>

in Arabic and published by Woepcke, 1856). Lastly, in
astronomy he is credited by Ptolemy with an explanation of
the motion of the planets by a system of epicycles; he also

<p><span class="bold">APOLLONIUS OF RHODES<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Rhodius</span>), a Greek epic poet
and grammarian, of Alexandria, who flourished under the
Ptolemies Philopator and Epiphanes (222-181 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). He was
the pupil of Callimachus, with whom he subsequently quarrelled.
In his youth he composed the work for which he is known&mdash;<i>Argonautica</i>,
an epic in four books on the legend of the Argonauts.
When he read it at Alexandria, it was rejected through the
influence of Callimachus and his party. Disgusted with his
failure, Apollonius withdrew to Rhodes, where he was very
successful as a rhetorician, and a revised edition of his epic was
well received. In recognition of his talents the Rhodians
bestowed the freedom of their city upon him&mdash;the origin of his
surname. Returning to Alexandria, he again recited his poem,
this time with general applause. In 196, Ptolemy Epiphanes
appointed him librarian of the Museum, which office he probably
held until his death. As to the <i>Argonautica</i>, Longinus&rsquo; (<i>De
Sublim</i>. p. 54, 19) and Quintilian&rsquo;s (<i>Instit</i>, x. 1, 54) verdict of
mediocrity seems hardly deserved; although it lacks the naturalness
of Homer, it possesses a certain simplicity and contains
some beautiful passages. There is a valuable collection of
scholia. The work, highly esteemed by the Romans, was
imitated by Virgil (<i>Aeneid</i>, iv.), Varro Atacinus, and Valerius
Flaccus. Marianus (about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 500) paraphrased it in iambic
trimeters. Apollonius also wrote epigrams; grammatical and
critical works; and <span class="grk" title="Ktiseis">&#922;&#964;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span> (the foundations of cities).</p>

the oriental mysticism of magi, Brahmans and gymnosophists.
The narrative of his travels given by his disciple Damis and
reproduced by Philostratus is so full of the miraculous that many
have regarded him as an imaginary character. On his return
to Europe he was saluted as a magician, and received the greatest
reverence from priests and people generally. He himself claimed
only the power of foreseeing the future; yet in Rome it was said
that he raised from death the body of a noble lady. In the halo
of his mysterious power he passed through Greece, Italy and
Spain. It was said that he was accused of treason both by Nero
and by Domitian, but escaped by miraculous means. Finally
he set up a school at Ephesus, where he died, apparently at the
age of a hundred years. Philostratus keeps up the mystery of
his hero&rsquo;s life by saying, &ldquo;Concerning the manner of his death,
<i>if he did die</i>, the accounts are various.&rdquo; The work of Philostratus
composed at the instance of Julia, wife of Severus, is generally
regarded as a religious work of fiction. It contains a number of
obviously fictitious stories, through which, however, it is not
impossible to discern the general character of the man. In the 3rd
century, Hierocles (<i>q.v.</i>) endeavoured to prove that the doctrines
and the life of Apollonius were more valuable than those of Christ,
and, in modern times, Voltaire and Charles Blount (1654-1693),
the English freethinker, have adopted a similar standpoint. Apart
from this extravagant eulogy, it is absurd to regard Apollonius
merely as a vulgar charlatan and miracle-monger. If we cut
away the mass of mere fiction which Philostratus accumulated,
we have left a highly imaginative, earnest reformer who laboured
to infuse into the flaccid dialectic of paganism a saner spirit of
practical morality.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APOLLONIUS OF TYRE,<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> a medieval tale supposed to be
derived from a lost Greek original. The earliest mention of the
story is in the <i>Carmina</i> (Bk. vi. 8, II. 5-6) of Venantius Fortunatus,
in the second half of the 6th century, and the romance
may well date from three centuries earlier. It bears a marked
resemblance to the <i>Antheia and Habrokomes</i> of Xenophon of
Ephesus. The story relates that King Antiochus, maintaining
incestuous relations with his daughter, kept off her suitors by
asking them a riddle, which they must solve on pain of losing
their heads. Apollonius of Tyre solved the riddle, which had
to do with Antiochus&rsquo;s secret. He returned to Tyre, and, to
escape the king&rsquo;s vengeance, set sail in search of a place of refuge.
In Cyrene he married the daughter of King Archistrates, and
presently, on receiving news of the death of Antiochus, departed
to take possession of the kingdom of Antioch, of which he was,
for no clear reason, the heir. On the voyage his wife died, or
rather seemed to die, in giving birth to a daughter, and the
sailors demanded that she should be thrown overboard. Apollonius
left his daughter, named Tarsia, at Tarsus in the care
of guardians who proved false to their trust. Father, mother,
and daughter were only reunited after fourteen years&rsquo; separation
and many vicissitudes. The earliest Latin MS. of this tale,
preserved at Florence, dates from the 9th or 10th century.
The pagan features of the supposed original are by no means
all destroyed. The ceremonies observed by Tarsia at her nurse&rsquo;s
grave, and the preparations for the burning of the body of
Apollonius&rsquo;s wife, are purely pagan. The riddles which Tarsia
propounds to her father are obviously interpolated. They are
taken from the <i>Enigmata</i> of Caelius Firmianus Symposius. The
many inconsistencies of the story seem to be best explained by
the supposition (E. Rohde, <i>Der griechische Roman</i>, 2nd ed.,
1900, pp. 435 <i>et seq</i>.) that the Antiochus story was originally
entirely separate from the story of Apollonius&rsquo;s wanderings,
and was clumsily tacked on by the Latin author. The romance
kept its form through a vast number of medieval rearrangements,
and there is little change in its outlines as set forth in the Shakespearian
play of <i>Pericles</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Latin tale is preserved in about 100 MSS., and was printed
by M. Velser (Augsburg, 1595), by J. Lapaume in <i>Script. Erot</i>. (Didot,
Paris, 1856), and by A. Riese in the <i>Bibl. Teubneriana</i> (1871, new ed.
1893). The most widespread versions in the middle ages were those
of Godfrey of Viterbo in his <i>Pantheon</i> (1185), where it is related as
authentic history, and in the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i> (cap. 153), which
formed the basis of the German folk-tale by H. Steinhöwel (Augsburg,
1471), the Dutch version (Delft, 1493), the French in <i>Le Violier
des histoires romaines</i> (Paris, 1521), the English, by Laurence Twine
(London, 1576, new ed. 1607), also of the Scandinavian, Czech, and
Hungarian tales.</p>

<p>In England a translation was made as early as the 11th century
(ed. B. Thorpe, 1834, and J. Zupitza in <i>Archiv für neuere Sprachen</i>,
1896); there is a Middle English metrical version (J.O. Halliwell,
<i>A New Boke about Shakespeare</i>, 1850), by a poet who says he was
vicar of Wimborne; John Gower uses the tale as an example of the
seventh deadly sin in the eighth book of his <i>Confessio Amantis</i>;
Robert Copland translated a prose romance of <i>Kynge Apollyne of
Thyre</i> (Wynkyn de Worde, 1510) from the French; <i>Pericles</i> was
entered at Stationers&rsquo; Hall in 1607, and was followed in the next
year by George Wilkins&rsquo;s novel, <i>The Painfull Adventures of Pericles,
Prynce of Tyre</i> (ed. Tycho Mommsen, Oldenburg, 1857), and George
Lillo drew his play <i>Marina</i> (1738) from the piece associated with
Shakespeare; <i>Orendel</i>, by a Middle High German minnesinger,
contains some of the episodes of <i>Apollonius</i>; Heinrich von Neustadt
wrote a poem of 20,000 lines on <i>Apollonius von Tyrland</i> (<i>c</i>. 1400);
the story was well known in Spanish, <i>Libre de Apolonio</i> (verse, <i>c</i>.
1200), and in J. de Timoneda&rsquo;s <i>Patrañuelo</i> (1576); in French much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
of it was embodied in <i>Jourdain de Blaives</i> (13th cent.), and it also

Alexandrine Jew who after Paul&rsquo;s first visit to Corinth worked
there in a similar way (1 Cor. iii. 6). He was with Paul at a
later date in Ephesus (1 Cor. xvi. 12). In 1 Cor. i. 10-12 we read
of four parties in the Corinthian church, of which two attached
themselves to Paul and Apollos respectively, using their names,
though the &ldquo;division&rdquo; can hardly have been due to conflicting
doctrines. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paul</a></span>.) From Acts xviii. 24-28 we learn that he
spoke and taught with power and success. He may have captivated
his hearers by teaching &ldquo;wisdom,&rdquo; as P.W. Schmiedel
suggests, in the allegorical style of Philo, and he was evidently
a man of unusual magnetic force. There seems to be some contradiction
between Acts xviii. 25 <i>a b</i> and Acts xviii. 25 <i>c</i>, 26 <i>b c</i>;
and it has been suggested that these latter passages are subsequent
accretions. Since Apollos was a Christian and &ldquo;taught
exactly,&rdquo; he could hardly have been acquainted only with
John&rsquo;s baptism or have required to be taught Christianity more
thoroughly by Aquila and Priscilla. Martin Luther regarded
Apollos as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and many
scholars since have shared his view.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Jerome says that Apollos was so dissatisfied with the division at
Corinth, that he retired into Crete with Zenas, a doctor of the law;
and that the schism having been healed by Paul&rsquo;s letter to the
Corinthians, Apollos returned to the city, and became its bishop.
Less probable traditions assign to him the bishopric of Duras, or of
Iconium in Phrygia, or of Caesarea.</p>

means &ldquo;destroyer&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="apollyein">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to destroy), is taken from
Rev. ix. 11, where it represents the Hebrew word <i>Abaddon</i> (lit.
&ldquo;place of destruction,&rdquo; but here personified). The identification
with the Asmodeus (<i>q.v.</i>) of Tobit iii. 8 is erroneous.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APOLOGETICS,<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> in theology, the systematic statement of the
grounds which Christians allege for belief in (at least) a <i>supernatural
revelation</i> and a <i>divine redemption</i> (cf. <i>e.g.</i> Heb. i. 1-3).
The majority of apologists in the past have further believed in
an <i>infallible Bible</i>; but they admit this position can only be
reached at a late stage in the argument. We should note, however,
that even a liberal orthodoxy, while saying nothing about
infallibility, is pledged to the <i>essential</i> authority of the Bible;
it cannot <i>e.g.</i> simply ignore the Old Testament with F.E.D.
Schleiermacher. Catholic apologetics must further give a
central position to <i>Church</i> authority, which Roman Catholics
explicitly define as infallible; but this position too is debated
in a late section of their system. On the other hand, there may
be a Christianity which seeks to extricate the &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; from
the &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; (Arnold Toynbee, characterizing T.H. Green).
It would only lead to confusion, however, if we called this method
&ldquo;apologetic.&rdquo; Any <i>single</i> effort in apologetics may be termed
&ldquo;an apology.&rdquo; More elaborate contrasts have been proposed
between the two words, but are of little practical importance.</p>

<p>I. <i>The Word itself.</i>&mdash;In Greek, <span class="grk" title="apologia">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#945;</span> is the defendant&rsquo;s reply
(personally, not through a lawyer) to the speech for the prosecution&mdash;<span class="grk" title="kataegoria">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;</span>.
Sometimes defendants&rsquo; speeches passed into
literature, <i>e.g.</i> Plato&rsquo;s splendid version of the <i>Apology</i> of Socrates.
Thus, in view of persecution or slander, the Christian church
naturally produced literary &ldquo;Apologies,&rdquo; The word has never
quite lost this connotation of standing on the defensive and
rebutting criticism; <i>e.g.</i> Anselm&rsquo;s <i>Apologia contra insipientem
Gaunilonem</i> (<i>c.</i> 1100); or the Lutheran <i>Apology for the Augsburg
Confession</i> (1531); or J.H. Newman&rsquo;s <i>Apologia pro vita sua</i>
(1864); or A.B. Bruce&rsquo;s <i>Apologetics; or Christianity Defensively
Stated</i> (1892). Of course, defence easily passes into counterattack,
as when early apologists denounce Greek and Roman
religion. Yet the purpose may be defence even then. And
there is perhaps a reason of a deeper kind for holding Apologetics
to the defensive. Christianity is a prophetic religion. Now a
prophet does not argue; he declares what he feels to be God&rsquo;s
will. For himself, he rests, like the mystic, upon an immediate
vision of truth; but he differs from most mystics in having a
message for others; and&mdash;again unlike most mystics&mdash;he
addresses the hearer&rsquo;s <i>conscience</i>, which we might call (in one
sense) the mystic element in every man&mdash;or better, perhaps, the
prophetic. Can the positive grounds for a prophet&rsquo;s message
be analysed and stated in terms of argument? If so, apologetics
is literally a science, and it is pedantry to claim the defensive
and pretend to throw the <i>onus probandi</i> upon objectors. But,
if not, then apologetics is a mere auxiliary, and is only &ldquo;a
science&rdquo; in so far as it presents a <i>conscious</i> and <i>systematic</i> plea.
Bruce&rsquo;s title, and his programme of &ldquo;succouring distressed faith,&rdquo;
imply the latter alternative; the moral appeal of Christianity,
primary and essential; its confirmation by argument, secondary.
The view has its difficulties; but it is hignly suggestive.</p>

<p>The word <span class="grk" title="apologia">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#945;</span> is used by Origen (<i>Contra Cel.</i> ii. 65, v. 19)
of the general Christian defence. But the introduction of the
adjective &ldquo;apologetic&rdquo; and of the substantive &ldquo;apologetics&rdquo; is
recent. They are serviceable as bracketing together (1) Natural
Theology or Theism, (2) Christian Evidences&mdash;chiefly &ldquo;miracles&rdquo;
and &ldquo;prophecy&rdquo;; or, on a more modern view, chiefly the
character and personality of Christ. The lower usage of Apology
(as expression of regret for a fault) has tipped many a sarcasm
besides George III.&rsquo;s on the occasion of Bishop Watson&rsquo;s book,
&ldquo;I did not know that the Bible needed an apology!&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. <i>Apologetics in the Bible.</i>&mdash;The Old Testament does not
argue in support of its beliefs, unless when (chiefly in parts of
the Wisdom literature) it seeks to rebut moral difficulties (cf.
T.K. Cheyne, <i>Job and Solomon</i>; A.S. Peake, <i>Problem of Suffering
in the Old Testament</i>, 1904). The New Testament reflects
chiefly controversy with Jews. Great emphasis is laid upon
alleged fulfilments&mdash;striking or fanciful, but very generally
striking to that age&mdash;of Old Testament prophecy (Matt. especially;
rather differently Ep. to Heb.). The miracles of Jesus are
also canvassed. Jews do not deny their wonderful character,
but attribute them to black art (Mark iii. 22 &amp;c., &amp;c.). On the
other hand, Christians and Jews are pretty well agreed on natural
theology; so the New Testament tends to take its theism for
granted. However, Rom. i. 20 has had great influence on
Christian theology (<i>e.g.</i> Thomas Aquinas) in leading it to base
theism upon reason or argument. One apologetic contention,
aimed at Gentile readers, is found among the motives of Acts.
Christianity is not a lawless but an excellent law-abiding faith.
So (it is alleged) rulers, both Jewish and Gentile, have often
admitted (xviii. 14; xix. 37; xxiii. 9; xxvi. 32).</p>

<p>III. <i>Early Christian.</i>&mdash;When we leave the New Testament,
apologetics becomes conspicuous until the political triumph of
Christianity, and even somewhat later. The atmosphere is no
longer Jewish but fully Greek. True there are, as always,
Jewish controversialists. Justin Martyr writes a <i>Dialogue with
Trypho</i>; Origen deals with many anti-Christian arguments
borrowed by Celsus from a certain nameless Jew. Yet Greece
was the sovereign power in all the world of ancient culture.
And so Christianity was necessarily Hellenized, necessarily
philosophized. One result was to bring natural theology into
the forefront. A pure morality, belief in one God, hopes extending
beyond death&mdash;these appealed to the age; the Church
taught them as philosophically true <i>and</i> divinely revealed.
But, further still, philosophy offered a vehicle which could be
applied to the contents of Christianity. The Platonic or eclectic
theism, which adopted the conception of the Logos, made a
place for Christ in terms of philosophy within the Godhead.
(John i. 1 may or may not be affected by Philo; it is almost or
quite solitary in the N.T.) Similarly, the immortality of the
soul may be maintained on Platonic or quasi-Platonic lines, as
by St Athanasius (<i>Contra Gentes</i>, § 33)&mdash;a writer who repeatedly
quotes the Alexandrian Book of Wisdom, in which Platonism
and the Old Testament had already joined partnership. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
phase of Platonism, however, was much more slowly adopted.
The earlier apologists dispute the natural immortality of the
soul; Athanasius himself, in <i>De Incarnatione Dei</i>, §§ 4, 5, tones
down the teaching of <i>Wisdom</i>; and the somewhat eccentric
writer Arnobius, a layman&mdash;from Justin Martyr downwards
apologetics has always been largely in the hands of laymen&mdash;stands
for what has recently been called &ldquo;conditional immortality&rdquo;&mdash;eternal
life for the righteous, the children of God, alone.</p>

<p>Allied with this more empiricist stand-point is the assertion
that Greek philosophy borrowed from Moses; but in studying
the Fathers we constantly find that groundless assertion
uttered in the same breath with the dominant Idealist view,
according to which Greek philosophy was due to incomplete
revelation from the divine Logos.</p>

<p>On purely defensive lines, early apologists rebut charges of
cannibalism and sexual promiscuity; the Christians had to
meet in secret, and the gossip of a rotten age drew malignant
conclusions. They make counter attacks on polytheism as a
folly and on the shamefulness of obscene myths. Here they are
in line with non-Christian writers or culture-mockers like Lucian
of Samosata; or graver spirits like Porphyry, who champions
Neo-Platonism as a rival to Christianity, and does pioneer work
in criticism by attacks on some of the Old Testament books.
Turning to Christian evidence proper, we are struck with the
continued prominence of the argument from prophecy. The
Old Testament was an immense religious asset to the early
church. Their enemies had nothing like it; and&mdash;the N.T.
canon being as yet but half formed&mdash;the Old Testament was
pushed into notice by dwelling on this imperfect &ldquo;argument,&rdquo;
which grew more extravagant as the partial control exercised
by Jewish learning disappeared. An argument from miracles
is also urged, though with more reserve. Formally, every one
in that age admitted the supernatural. The question was,
whose supernatural? And how far did it carry you? Miracle
could not be to a 3rd century writer what it was to W. Paley&mdash;a
conclusive and well-nigh solitary proof. Other apologies are
by Aristides (recently recovered in translation), Athenagoras
(&ldquo;elegant&rdquo;), Eusebius of Caesarea, Cyril of Alexandria; in
Latin by Minucius Felix, Tertullian (a masculine spirit and
phrase-coiner like T. Carlyle, if bitterer still), Lactantius Firmianus,
&amp;c., &amp;c.<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>As Christianity wins the day, a new objection is raised to it.
The age is full of troubles; Christianity is ruining the empire!
Besides notices elsewhere, we find the charge specially dealt
with by St Augustine and his friends. Paulus Orosius argues
that the world has always been a vale of tears. Salvian contends
that not the acceptance of Christianity, but the sins of the people
are bringing trouble upon them; and he gives ugly evidence
of the continued prevalence of vice. Most impressive of all
was Augustine&rsquo;s own contribution in <i>The City of God</i>. Powers
created by worldliness and sin are crumbling, as they well
may; &ldquo;the city of God remaineth!&rdquo; Whether he meant it
so or not, the saint&rsquo;s argument became a programme and an
apologia for the imperializing of the Western Church under the
leadership of Rome during the middle ages.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Middle Ages.</i>&mdash;From the point of view of apologetics, we
may mass together the long stretch of history which covers the
period between the disappearance and the re-appearance of free
discussion. When emperors became converts, the church, so
lately a victim and a pleader for liberty, readily learned to
persecute. Under such conditions there is little scope for
apologetics. Force kills argument and drives doubt below the
smooth surface of a nominal conformity. But there were two
influences beyond the bounds or beyond the power of the
christianized empire. The Jew remained, as always, stubbornly
unconvinced, and, as often, fond of slanders. Many of the
principal medieval attempts in apologetics are directed chiefly
against him, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>Pugio Fidei</i> of Raymond Martini (<i>c.</i> 1280),
which became one of Pascal&rsquo;s sources (see V. below), or Peter
Abelard&rsquo;s <i>Dialogus inter Judaeum Philosophum et Christianum</i>.
And the Moslem came on the scenes bringing, as a gift for
Christendom, fuller knowledge of classical, especially Aristotelian,
texts. The Jews, less bitterly opposed to Mahommedanism
than the Christians were, caught fire more rapidly,
and in some cases served as an intermediate link or channel
of communication. These two religions anticipated the discussion
of the problem of faith and reason in the Christian
church. According to the great Avicenna and Maimonides,
faith and the highest reason are sure to coincide (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arabian
Philosophy</a></span>). According to Ghazali, in his <i>Destruction of Philosophers</i>,
the various schools of philosophy cancel each other;
reason is bankrupt; faith is everything. (So nearly Jehuda
Halevi.) According to Averroes, reason suffices, and faith, with
(what he considers) its dreams of immortality and the like, is
useful only for the ignorant masses. Christian theology, however,
strikes out a line of its own. Moslems and Jews were
applying Aristotelian philosophy to rigorously monotheistic
faiths; Christianity had been encouraged by Platonism in
teaching a trinity of divine persons, and Platonism of a certain
order long dominated the middle ages as part of the Augustinian
tradition. In sympathy with this Platonism, the medieval
church began by assuming the entire mutual harmony of faith
and reason. Such is the teaching, along different lines, alike
of St Anselm and of Abelard. But, when increased knowledge
of Aristotle&rsquo;s texts (and of the commentaries) led to the victory
of a supposed Aristotelianism over a supposed Platonism,
Albertus Magnus, and his still more distinguished pupil Thomas
Aquinas, mark certain doctrines as belonging to faith but not
to reason. They adhere to the general position with exceptions
(in the case of what had been considered Platonic doctrines).
From the point of view of philosophy, this was a compromise.
Faith and reason partly agree, partly diverge. The tendency
of the later middle ages is to add to the number of the doctrines
with which philosophy cannot deal. Thomas&rsquo;s great rival, Duns
Scotus, does this to a large extent, at times affirming &ldquo;two
truths.&rdquo; The latter position, ascribed by the schoolmen to the
Averroists, becomes dominant among the later Nominalists,
William of Occam and his disciples, who withdraw <i>all</i> doctrines
of faith from the sphere of reason. This was a second and a
more audacious compromise. It is not exactly an attempt to
base Christian faith on rational scepticism. It is a consistent
policy of harbouring inconsistencies in the same mind. A
statement may be true in philosophy and false in theology, or
vice versa. To the standpoint of Aquinas, however, the Church
of Rome (at least in regard to the basis of doctrine) has more
and more returned. The councils of Trent and of the Vatican
mark the Two Truths hypothesis as heretical, when they affirm
that there <i>is</i> a natural knowledge of God and natural certainty
of immortality. Along with this affirmation, the Church of
Rome (if less decisively) has adopted the limitations of the
Thomist theory by the condemnation of &ldquo;Ontologism&rdquo;;
certain mysterious doctrines are beyond reason. This cautious
compromise sanctioned by the Church does not represent the
<i>extremest</i> reaction against nominalism. Even in the nominalistic
epoch we have Raymond of Sabunde&rsquo;s <i>Natural Theology</i> (according
to the article in Herzog-Hauck, not the title of the oldest
Paris MS., but found in later MSS. and almost all the printed
editions) or <i>Liber Creaturarum</i> (<i>c.</i> 1435). The book is not what
moderns (schooled unconsciously in post-Reformation developments
of Thomist ideas) expect under the name of natural
theology. It is an attempt once more to demonstrate <i>all</i>
scholastic dogmas out of the book of creation or on principles
of natural reason. At many points it follows Anselm closely,
and, of course, very often &ldquo;makes light work&rdquo; of its task.</p>

<p>The Thomist compromise&mdash;or even the more sceptical view
of &ldquo;two truths&rdquo;&mdash;has the merit of giving filling <i>of a kind</i> to
the formula &ldquo;supernatural revelation&rdquo;&mdash;mysteries inaccessible
to reason, beyond discovery and beyond comprehension.
According to earlier views&mdash;repeatedly revived in Protestantism&mdash;revelation
is just philosophy over again. Can the choice be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span>
fairly stated? If revelation is thought of as God&rsquo;s personal
word, and redemption as his personal deed, is it reasonable to
view them either as open to a sort of scientific prediction or as
capricious and unintelligible? Even in the middle ages there
were not wanting those&mdash;the St Victors, Bonaventura&mdash;who
sought to vindicate mystical if not moral redemption as the
central thought of Christianity.</p>

<p>V. <i>Earlier Modern Period.</i>&mdash;It will be seen that apologetics by
no means reissued unchanged from the long period of authority.
The compromise of Aquinas, though not unchallenged, holds the
field and that even with Protestants. G.W. Leibnitz devotes
an introductory chapter in his <i>Théodicée</i>, 1710 (as against Pierre Bayle), to faith and reason. He is a good enough Lutheran to
quote as a &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; the Eucharist no less than the Trinity,
while he insists that truths <i>above</i> are not <i>against</i> reason. Stated thus baldly, has the distinction any meaning? The more celebrated
and central thesis of the book&mdash;this finite universe, the
best of all such that are possible&mdash;also restates positions of
Augustine and Aquinas.</p>

<p>Before modern philosophy began its career, there was a great
revival of ancient philosophy at the Renaissance; sometimes
anti-Christian, sometimes pro-Christian. The latter furnishes
apologies by Marsilio Ficino, Agostino Steuco, J.L. Vives.</p>

<p>Early in the modern period occurs the great name of Blaise
Pascal (1623-1662). A staunch Roman Catholic, but belonging
to a school of Augustinian enthusiasts (the Jansenists), whom
the Church put down as heretics, he stands pretty much apart
from the general currents. His <i>Pensées</i>, published posthumously,
seems to have been meant for a systematic treatise, but it
has come to us in fragments. Once again, a lay apologist! A
layman&rsquo;s work may have the advantage of originality or the
drawback of imperfect knowledge. Pascal&rsquo;s work exhibits both
characters. It has the originality of rare genius, but it borrows
its material (as industrious editors have shown) from very few
sources&mdash;the <i>Pugio Fidei</i>, M. de Montaigne, P. Charron. Ideas
as well as learning are largely Montaigne&rsquo;s. The latter&rsquo;s cheerful
man-of-the-world scepticism is transfigured in Pascal to a deep
distrust of human reason, in part, perhaps, from anti-Protestant
motives. But this attitude, while not without parallels both
earlier (Ghazali, Jehuda Halevi) and later (H.L. Mansel), has
peculiarities in Pascal. It is <i>fallen</i> man whom he pursues with
his fierce scorn; his view of man&rsquo;s nature&mdash;intellect as well as
character&mdash;is to be read in the light of his unflinching Augustinianism.
Again, Pascal, unlike most apologists, belongs to the
small company of saintly souls. This philosophical sceptic is
full of humble joy in salvation, of deep love for the Saviour.</p>

<p>Another French Roman Catholic apologist, P.D. Huet  (1630-1721)&mdash;within
the conditions of his age a prodigy of learning
(in apologetics see his <i>Demonstratio Evangelica</i>)&mdash;is
not uninfluenced by Pascal (<i>Traité de la faiblesse de l&rsquo;esprit humaine</i>).</p>

<p>As we might expect, Protestant lands are more busily occupied
with apologetics. Intolerant reliance upon <i>force</i> presents
greater difficulties to them; soon it grows quite obsolete. Benedict
Spinoza, the eminent Jewish pantheist (1632-1677), to whom
miracle is impossible, revelation a phrase, and who renews
pioneer work in Old Testament criticism, finds at least a fair
measure of liberty and comfort in Holland (his birth-land).
Bayle, the historical sceptic, lectured and published his learned
<i>Dictionnaire</i> (1696) at Rotterdam. From Holland, earlier, had
proceeded an apologetic work by a man of European fame.
Hugo Grotius&rsquo;s <i>De Veritate Christianae Religionis</i> (1627) is partly
the medieval tradition:&mdash;Oppose Mahommedans and Jews!
It is partly practical:&mdash;Arm Christian sailors against religious
danger! But in its cool spirit it forecasts the coming age, whose
master is John Locke. His <i>Reasonableness of Christianity</i> (1695)
is the thesis of &ldquo;a whole century&rdquo; of theologians. And his <i>Essay
on the Human Understanding</i> (1690) is almost a Bible to men of
education during the same period; its lightest word treasured.
Locke does not break with the compromise of Aquinas. But he
transfers attention from <i>contents</i> to <i>proof</i>. Reason
proves that a revelation has been made-and then submits. Leibnitz
has to supplement rather than correct Locke on this point.</p>

<p>In such an atmosphere, deism readily uttered its protest
against mysterious revelation. Deism is, in fact, the Thomist
natural theology (more clearly distinguished from dogmatic
theology than in the middle ages, alike by Protestants and by
the post-Tridentine Church of Rome) now dissolving partnership
with dogmatic and starting in business for itself. Or it is the
doctrine of unfallen man&rsquo;s &ldquo;natural state&rdquo;&mdash;a doctrine intensified
in Protestantism&mdash;separating itself from the theologians&rsquo;
grave doctrine of sin. If Socinianism had challenged natural
theology&mdash;Christ, according to it, was the prophet who first
revealed the way to eternal life&mdash;it had glorified the natural
powers of man; and the learning of the Arminian divines
(friends of Grotius and Locke) had helped to modernize Christian
apologetics upon rational lines. Deism now taught that reason,
or &ldquo;the light of nature,&rdquo; was all-sufficient.</p>

<p>Not to dwell upon earlier continental &ldquo;Deists&rdquo; (mentioned by
Viret as quoted first in Bayle&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i> and again in the
introduction to Leland&rsquo;s <i>View of the Deistical Writers</i>), Lord
Herbert of Cherbury (<i>De Veritate</i>, 1624; <i>De Religione Gentilium</i>,
1645?&mdash;according to J.G. Walch&rsquo;s <i>Bibliotheca Theologica</i> (1757)
not published complete until 1663) was universally understood
as hinting conclusions hostile to Christianity (cf. also T. Hobbes,
<i>Leviathan</i>, 1651, ch. xxxi.; Spinoza, <i>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</i>,
1670, ch. xiv.). Professedly, Herbert&rsquo;s contention
merely is that non-Christians feeling after the &ldquo;supreme God&rdquo;
and the law of righteousness must have a chance of salvation.
Herbert was also epoch-making for the whole 18th century in
teaching that <i>priests</i> had <i>corrupted</i> this primitive faith. During
the 18th century deism spread widely, though its leaders were
&ldquo;irrepressible men like Toland, men of mediocre culture and
ability like Anthony Collins, vulgar men like Chubb, irritated
and disagreeable men like Matthew Tindal, who conformed that
he might enjoy his Oxford fellowship and wrote anonymously
that he might relieve his conscience&rdquo; (A.M. Fairbairn). More
distinguished sympathizers are Edward Gibbon, who has the
deistic spirit, and David Hume, the historian and philosophical
sceptic, who has at least the letter of the deistic creed (<i>Dialogues
Concerning Natural Religion</i>), and who uses Pascal&rsquo;s appeal to
&ldquo;faith&rdquo; in a spirit of mockery (<i>Essay on Miracles</i>). In France
the new school found powerful speaking-trumpets, especially
Voltaire, the idol of his age&mdash;a great denier and scoffer, but
always sincerely a believer in the God of reason&mdash;and the deeper
but wilder spirit of J.J. Rousseau. Others in France developed
still more startling conclusions from Locke&rsquo;s principles, E.B.
Condillac&rsquo;s sensationalism&mdash;Locke&rsquo;s philosophy purged of its
more ideal if less logical elements&mdash;leading on to materialism in
J.O. de la Mettrie; and at least one of the Encyclopedists
(P.H. von Holbach) capped materialism with confessed atheism.</p>

<p>In Germany the parallel movement of &ldquo;illumination&rdquo; (H.S.
Reimarus; J.S. Semler, pioneer in N.T. criticism; and a
layman, the great Lessing) took the form of &ldquo;rationalism&rdquo;
within the church&mdash;interpreting Bible texts by main force in a
way which the age thought &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; (H.E.G. Paulus,
1761-1851, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>Among the innumerable English anti-deistic writers (see
W. Law, The <i>Case of Reason</i>; R. Bentley, or &ldquo;Phileleutherus
Lipsiensis&rdquo;; &amp;c., &amp;c.), three are of chief importance. Nathaniel
Lardner (Arian, 1684-1768) stands in the front rank of the
scholarship of his time, and uses his vast knowledge to maintain
the genuineness of all books of the New Testament and the
perfect accuracy of its history. Joseph Butler, a very original,
careful and honest thinker, lifts controversy with deists from
details to principles in his <i>Analogy of Religion both Natural and
Revealed to the Constitution and Course of Nature</i> (1736). This
title introduces us to a new conception. Deists and orthodox
in those days agreed in recognizing not merely natural theology
but natural religion&mdash;&ldquo;essential religion,&rdquo; Butler more than
once styles it; the expression shows how near he stood intellectually
to those he criticized. But morally he stood aloof.
In part i.&mdash;on Natural Religion&mdash;he defends a moral or punishing
Deity against the sentimental softness of the age. The God of
Nature, whom deists confess does punish in time, if they will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span>
but look at the facts; why not in eternity? &ldquo;Morality,&rdquo; as
others have confessed, is &ldquo;the nature of things&rdquo;! Not the Being
of God is discussed&mdash;Butler will not waste words on triflers (as
he thinks them) who deny that&mdash;but God&rsquo;s character. Unfortunately
(perhaps) Butler prefers to argue on <i>admitted
principles</i>; holds much of his own moral belief in reserve;
tries to reduce everything to a question of <i>probable fact</i>. If
this hampers him in part i., the situation appears still worse in
part ii., which is directly occupied with the defence of Christianity.
Butler says nothing about incomprehensible mysteries,
and protests that reason is the only ground we have to proceed
upon. But by treating the atonement simply as revealed (and
unexplained) matter of fact&mdash;in spite of some partial analogies
in human experience, a thing essentially anomalous&mdash;Butler
repeats, and applies to the <i>moral</i> contents of Christianity, what
Aquinas said of its speculative doctrines. (Whether one calls the
unknowable a revealed mystery or an unexplained and inexplicable
fact makes little difference.) William Paley (1743-1805)
borrows from many writers; he borrows Lardner&rsquo;s learning
and Butler&rsquo;s &ldquo;particular evidence for Christianity,&rdquo; viz. miracles,
prophecy and &ldquo;history&rdquo;; and he states his points with perfect
clearness. No man ever filled a typical position more exactly
than Paley. Eighteenth-century ethics&mdash;Hedonism, with a
theological background. Empiricist Natural Theology&mdash;the
argument from Design. Christian Evidences&mdash;the strong
probability of the resurrection of Christ and the consequent
authority of his teaching. <i>Horae Paulinae</i>&mdash;mutual confirmations
of <i>Acts</i> and Epistles; better, though one-sided. When
such exclusively &ldquo;external&rdquo; arguments are urged, the contents
of Christianity go for next to nothing.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Later Modern Period.</i>&mdash;Towards the end of the 18th century
a new epoch of reconstruction begins in the thought and life of
civilization. The leader in speculative philosophy is Immanuel
Kant, though he includes many agnostic elements, and draws
the inference (which some things in the letter of Butler might
seem to warrant) that the essence of Christianity is an ethical
theism. While he thus created a new and more ethical &ldquo;rationalism,&rdquo;
Kant&rsquo;s many-sided influence, alike in philosophy and in
theology, worked to further issues. He (and other Germans,
but not G.W.F. Hegel) was represented in England in a fragmentary
way by S.T. Coleridge (1772-1834), probably the most
typical figure of his period&mdash;another layman. His general
thought was that &ldquo;rationalism&rdquo; represents an uprising of the
lower reason or &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; against the higher or true
&ldquo;reason.&rdquo; The mysteries of theology are its best part&mdash;not
alien to reason but of its substance, the &ldquo;logos.&rdquo; This is to
upset the compromise of Aquinas and go back to a Christian
platonism. Of course the difficulty revives again: If a philosophy,
why supernaturally revealed? Thomas Arnold, criticizing
Edward Hawkins, appeals rather to the atonement as
deeper neglected truth. So in Scotland, Thomas Erskine and
Thomas Chalmers&mdash;the latter in contradiction to his earlier
position&mdash;hold that the doctrine of salvation, when translated
into experience, furnishes &ldquo;internal evidence&rdquo;&mdash;a somewhat
broader use of the phrase than when it applies merely to evidence
of date or authorship drawn from the contents of a book. This
gives a new and moral filling to the conception of &ldquo;supernatural
revelation&rdquo; The attempt to work out either of the reactions
against Thomism in new theological systems is pretty much
confined to Germany. Hegel&rsquo;s theological followers, of every
shade and party, represent the first, and Schleiermacher&rsquo;s the
second. Schleiermacher rejects natural religion in favour of the
positive religions, while the school of A. Ritschl and W. Herrmann
reject natural theology outright in favour of revelation&mdash;a
striking external parallel to early Socinianism. British and
American divines, on the other hand, are slow to suspect that a
new apologetic principle may mean a new system of apologetics,
to say nothing of a new dogmatic. Among the evangelicals, for
the most part, natural theology, far from being rejected, is not
even modified, and certain doctrines continue to be described as
incomprehensible mysteries. No Protestant, of course, can agree
with Roman Catholic theology that (supernatural) faith is an
obedient assent to church authority and the mysteries it dictates.
To Protestantism, faith is personal trust. But the principle is
hardly ever carried out to the end. Mysterious doctrines are
ascribed by Protestants to <i>scripture</i>; so half of revelation is
regarded as matter for blind assent, if another half is luminous
in experience. The movement of German philosophy which led
from Kant to Hegel has indeed found powerful British champions
(T.H. Green, J. and E. Caird, &amp;c.), but less churchly than
Coleridge (or F.D. Maurice or B.F. Westcott), though churchly
again in J.R. Illingworth and other contributors to <i>Lux Mundi</i>
(1890). Before this wave of thought, H.L. Mansel tried (1858)
to play Pascal&rsquo;s game on Kantian principles, developing the
sceptical side of Kant&rsquo;s many-faceted mind. But as he protested
against relying on the human conscience&mdash;the one element of
positive conviction spared by Kant&mdash;his ingenuity found few
admirers except H. Spencer, who claims him as justifying anti-Christian
agnosticism. Butler&rsquo;s tradition was more directly
continued by J.H. Newman&mdash;with modifications on becoming a
Roman Catholic in the light of the church&rsquo;s decision in favour of
Thomism. A.M. Fairbairn (<i>Catholicism, Roman and Anglican</i>,
ch. v., and elsewhere) and E.A. Abbott (<i>Philomythus</i>, and
elsewhere) suspect Newman of a sceptical leaven and extend the
criticism to Butler&rsquo;s doctrine of &ldquo;probability.&rdquo; Yet it seems
plain that any theology, maintaining redemption as historical
fact (and not merely ideal), must attach religious importance to
conclusions which are technically probable rather than proven.
If we transfer Christian evidence from the &ldquo;historical&rdquo; to the
&ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; with H. Rashdall&mdash;we surely cut down Christianity
to the limits of theism. And the <i>inner</i> mind of Butler
has moral anchorage in the <i>Analogy</i>, quite as much as in the
<i>Sermons</i>. It is in part ii. more than in part i. of his masterpiece
that the light seems to grow dim. Another of the Oxford converts
to Rome, W.G. Ward, made vigorous contributions to
natural theology.</p>

<p>VII. <i>Contents of Modern Apologetics.</i>&mdash;Superficially regarded,
philosophy ebbs and flows, whatever progress the debate may
reveal to speculative insight. Old positions re-emerge from
forgetfulness, and there is always a philosophy to back every
&ldquo;case.&rdquo; More visible dangers arise for the apologist in the region
of science, historical or physical. There the progress of truth,
within whatever limits, is manifest. <i>Essays and Reviews</i> (1860)
was a vehement announcement of scientific results&mdash;startling
English conservatism awake for the first time. And in the
scientific region the great apologetic classics, like Butler, are
hopelessly out of date. The modern apologist must do ephemeral
work&mdash;unless it should chance that he proves to be the skirmisher,
pioneering for a modified dogmatic. He holds a watching
brief. While he must beware of hasty speech, he has often to
plead that new knowledge does not really threaten faith; or
that it is not genuinely established knowledge at all; or else,
that faith has mistaken its own grounds, and will gain strength
by concentrating on its true field. The work is not always well
done; but the Christian church needs it.</p>

<p>1. <i>Apologetics and Philosophy.</i>&mdash;The main part of this subject
is discussed under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Theism</a></span>. Some notes may be added on special
points, (<i>a</i>) Freewill is generally assumed on the Christian side
(R.C. Church; Scottish philosophy; H. Lotze; J. Martineau;
W.G. Ward. Not in a libertarian sense; Leibnitz. New and
obscure issues raised by Kant). But there is no continuous
tradition or steady trend of discussion. (<i>b</i>) Personal immortality
is affirmed as philosophically certain by the Church of Rome
and many Protestant writers. Others teach &ldquo;conditional immortality.&rdquo;
Others base the hope on belief in the resurrection
of Christ, (<i>c</i>) Theodicy&mdash;the tradition of Leibnitz is preserved
(on libertarian lines) by Martineau (<i>A Study of Religion</i>, 1883).
See also F.R. Tennant&rsquo;s <i>Origin and Propagation of Sin</i> (1902)&mdash;sin
a &ldquo;bye-product&rdquo; of a generally good evolution. Others find
in the gospel of redemption the true theodicy. (<i>d</i>) The problem
of Christian apologetic has been simplified in the past by the
prevalence of the Christian ethics and temper even among many
non-Christians (<i>e.g.</i> J.S. Mill). But hereafter it may not prove
possible for the apologist to assume as unchallenged the Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>
moral outlook. Germans have suspected an anti-Christian
strain in Goethe; all the world knows of it in E. von Hartmann
or F. Nietzsche.</p>

<p>2. <i>Apologetics and Physical Science.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Copernicanism has
won its battles and the Church of Rome would fain have its error
forgotten. The admission is now general that the Bible cannot
be expected to use the language of scientific astronomy. Still,
it is not certain that the shock of Copernicanism on supernatural
Christianity is exhausted. (<i>b</i>) Geology has also won its battles,
and few now try to harmonize it with Genesis. (<i>c</i>) Evolution
came down from the clouds when C. Darwin and A.R. Wallace
succeeded in displacing the naïf conception of special creation
by belief in the origin of species out of other species through a
process of natural law. This gave immense vogue to wider and
vaguer theories of evolutionary process, notably to H. Spencer&rsquo;s
grandiose cosmic formula in terms of mechanism. Here the
apologist has more to say. The special Darwinian hypothesis&mdash;natural
&ldquo;selection&rdquo;&mdash;may or may not be true; it was at least
a fruitful suggestion. If true, it need not be exhaustive. Again,
evolution itself need not apply everywhere. We are offered a
philosophical rather than a scientific speculation when E. Caird
(<i>Evolution of Religion</i>, 1893) tries to vindicate Christianity as
the highest working of nature&mdash;true just <i>because</i> evolved from
lower religions. The Christian apologist indeed may himself
seek, following John Fiske, to philosophize evolution as a restatement
of natural theology&mdash;&ldquo;one God, one law, one element
and one far-off divine event&rdquo;&mdash;and as at least pointing <i>towards</i>
personal immortality. But if evolution is to be the whole truth
regarding Christianity, we should have to surrender both <i>supernatural
revelation</i> and <i>divine redemption</i>. And these, it may
be strongly urged, contain the magic of Christianity. Losing
them it might sink into a lifeless theory.</p>

<p>As far as pure science goes, the inference from science in
favour of materialism has visibly lost much of its plausibility,
and Protestant apologists would probably be prepared to accept
in advance all verified discoveries as belonging to a different
region from that of faith. Roman Catholic apologetic prefers to
negotiate in detail.</p>

<p>3. <i>Apologetics and History.</i>&mdash;History brings us nearer the
heart of the Christian position. (<i>a</i>) Old Testament criticism
won startling victories towards the end of the 19th century. It
blots out much supposed knowledge, but throws a vivid and
interesting light on the reconstrued process of history. Most
Protestants accept the general scheme of criticism; those who
hang back make not a few concessions (<i>e.g.</i> J. Orr, <i>Problem of
the O.T.</i>, 1906). The Roman Catholic Church again prefers an
attitude of reserve, (<i>b</i>) New Testament criticism raises even
more delicate issues. Positively it may be affirmed that the
recovered figure of the historical Jesus is the greatest asset in
the possession of modern Christian theology and apologetics.
The &ldquo;Lives&rdquo; of Christ, Roman Catholic and Protestant;
&ldquo;critical&rdquo; (D.F. Strauss, A. Renan, &amp;c., &amp;c.) and &ldquo;believing,&rdquo;
imply this at least. Negatively, &ldquo;unchallenged historical
certainties&rdquo; are becoming few in number, or are disappearing
altogether, through the industry of modern minds. True, the
Tübingen criticism of F.C. Baur and his school&mdash;important as
the first scientific attempt to conceive New Testament conditions
and literature as a whole&mdash;has been abandoned. (A. Ritschl&rsquo;s
<i>Entstehung der alt-katholischen Kirche</i>, 2nd edition, 1857, was an
especially telling reply.) The synoptic gospels are now treated
with considerable respect. It is no longer suggested in responsible
quarters that they are party documents sacrificing truth to
&ldquo;tendency.&rdquo; But not all quarters are responsible; and in the
effort to grasp scientifically, <i>i.e.</i> accurately, the amazing facts of
Christ and primitive Christianity, every imaginable hypothesis
is canvassed. Even the Roman Catholic Church produced the
Abbé Loisy (though he undertakes to play off church certainties
against historical uncertainties). Hitherto at least the fourth
gospel has been the touchstone. The authorship of the epistles
is in many cases a matter of subordinate importance; at least
for Protestants or for those surrendering Bible infallibility,
which Rome can hardly do. (<i>c</i>) New Testament history,
The apologist must maintain (1) that Jesus of Nazareth is a
real historical figure&mdash;a point well-nigh overlooked by Strauss,
and denied by some modern advocates of a mythical theory;
(2) that Jesus is knowable (not one &ldquo;of whom we really know
very little&rdquo;&mdash;B. Jowett) in his teaching, example, character,
historical personality; and that he is full of moral splendour.
On the other hand, faith has no special interest in claiming that
we can compose a biographical study of the development of
Jesus. Certainly no early writer thought of providing material
for such use. It is a common opinion in Germany that our
material is in fact too scanty or too self-contradictory. Yet the
fascination of the subject will always revive the attempt. If it
succeeds, there will be a new line of communication along
which that great personality will tell on men&rsquo;s minds and
hearts. If it fails&mdash;there are other channels; character can be
known and trusted even when we are baffled by a thing necessarily
so full of mystery as the development of a personality.
Notably, the manifest <i>non-consciousness of personal guilt</i> in
Jesus suggests to us his sinlessness. (3) Apologists maintain
that Jesus &ldquo;claimed&rdquo; Messiahship. There are speculative
constructions of gospel history which eliminate that claim;
and no doubt apologetics could&mdash;with more or less difficulty&mdash;restate
its position in a changed form if the paradox of to-day
became accepted as historical fact to-morrow. The central
apologetic thesis is the <i>uniqueness</i> of the &ldquo;only-begotten&rdquo;; it
is here that &ldquo;the supernatural&rdquo; passes into the substance of
Christian faith. But most probably the description of Jesus as
thus unique will continue to be associated with the allegation&mdash;He
told us so; he claimed Messiahship and &ldquo;died for the
claim.&rdquo; (See preface to 5th ed. of <i>Ecce Homo</i>.) Nor did so
superhuman a claim crush him, or deprive his soul of its balance.
He imparted to the title a grander significance out of the riches
of his personality. (4) In the light of this the &ldquo;argument from
prophecy&rdquo; is reconstructed. It ceases to lay much stress upon
coincidences between Old Testament predictions or &ldquo;types&rdquo;
and events in Christ&rsquo;s career. It becomes the assertion; historically,
providentially, the expectation of a <i>unique religious figure</i>
arose&mdash;&ldquo;the&rdquo; Messiah; and Jesus gave himself to be thought
of as that great figure. (5) It is also claimed as certain that Jesus
had marvellous powers of healing. More reserve is being shown
towards the other or &ldquo;nature&rdquo; miracles. These latter, it may
be remarked, are more unambiguously supernatural. But, if
Jesus really cured leprosy or really restored the dead to life, we
have miracle plainly enough in the region of healing. (6) For
Jesus&rsquo; own resurrection several lines of evidence are alleged.
(i.) All who believe that in any sense Christ rose again insist upon
the impression which his personality made during life. It was <i>he</i>
whose resurrection seemed credible! Some practically stop here;
the apologist proceeds. (ii.) There is the report of the empty
grave; historically, not easily waved aside. (iii.) We have New
Testament reports of appearances of the risen Jesus; subjective?
the mere clothing of the impression made by his personality
during life? or objective? &ldquo;telegrams&rdquo; from heaven (Th.
Keim)&mdash;&ldquo;Veridical Hallucinations&rdquo;? or something even more,
throwing a ray of light perhaps on the state and powers of the
happy dead? (iv.) There is the immense influence of Jesus Christ
in history, <i>associated with belief in him</i> as the risen Son of God.</p>

<p>In view of the claims of Jesus, different possibilities arise,
(i.) The evangelists impute to him a higher claim than he
made. This may be called the rationalistic solution; with
sympathy in Christ&rsquo;s ethical teaching, there is relief at minimizing
his great claim. So, brilliantly, Wellhausen&rsquo;s Gospel commentaries
and Introduction. (Mark fairly historical; other
gospels&rsquo; fuller account of Christ&rsquo;s teaching and claims unreliable.)
(ii.) The claim was fraudulent (Reimarus; Renan,
ed. 1; popular anti-Christian agitation). This is a counsel of
despair. (iii.) He was an enthusiastic dreamer, expecting the
world&rsquo;s end. This the apologist will recognize as the most
plausible hostile alternative. He may feel bound to admit an
element of illusion in Christ&rsquo;s vision&rsquo; of the future; but he will
contend that the apocalyptic form did not destroy the spiritual
content of Christ&rsquo;s revelations&mdash;nay, that it was itself the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
vehicle of great truths. So he will argue as the essence of the
matter that (iv.) he who has occupied Christ&rsquo;s place in history,
and won such reverence from the purest souls, was what he
claimed to be, and that his many-sidedness comes to focus and
harmony when we recognize him as the Christ of God and the
Saviour of the world.</p>

<p>To a less extent, similar problems and alternatives arise in
regard to the church:&mdash;Catholicism a compromise between
Jewish Christianity and Pauline or Gentile Christianity (F.C.
Baur, &amp;c.); Catholicism the Hellenizing of Christianity (A.
Ritschl, A. Harnack); the Catholic church for good and evil
the creation of St Paul (P. Wernle, H. Weinel); the church
supernaturally guided (R.C. apologetic; in a modified degree
High Church apologetic); essential&mdash;not necessarily exclusive&mdash;truth
of Paulinism, essential error in first principles of Catholicism
(Protestant apologetic).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Literature</span>.&mdash;Omitting the Christian fathers as remote from the
present day, we recognize as works of genius Pascal&rsquo;s <i>Pensées</i> and
Butler&rsquo;s <i>Analogy</i>, to which we might add J.R. Seeley&rsquo;s <i>Ecce Homo</i>
(1865). The philosophical, Platonist, or Idealist line of Christian
defence is represented among recent writers by J.R. Illingworth
[Anglican], in <i>Personality, Human and Divine</i> (1894), <i>Divine Immanence</i>
(1898), <i>Reason and Revelation</i> (1902), who at times seems
rather to presuppose the Thomist compromise, and A.M. Fairbairn
[Congregationalist], in <i>Place of Christ in Modern Theology</i> (1893),
<i>Philosophy of the Christian Religion</i> (1902). The appeal to ethical
or Christian experience&mdash;&ldquo;internal evidence&rdquo;&mdash;is found especially
in E.A. Abbott [Christianity supernatural and divine, but not

<p><span class="bold">APOLOGUE<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="apologos">&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>, a statement or account),
a short fable or allegorical story, meant to serve as a pleasant
vehicle for some moral doctrine or to convey some useful lesson.
One of the best known is that of Jotham in the Book of Judges
(ix. 7-15); others are &ldquo;The City Rat and Field Rat,&rdquo; by Horace,
&ldquo;The Belly and its Members,&rdquo; by the patrician Menenius Agrippa
in the second book of Livy, and perhaps most famous of all, those
of Aesop. The term is applied more particularly to a story in
which the actors or speakers are taken from the brute creation
or inanimate nature. An apologue is distinguished from a fable
in that there is always some moral sense present, which there
need not be in a fable. It is generally dramatic, and has been
defined as &ldquo;a satire in action.&rdquo; It differs from a parable in
several respects. A parable is equally an ingenious tale intended
to correct manners, but it can be <i>true</i>, while an apologue, with
its introduction of animals and plants, to which it lends our
ideas and language and emotions, is necessarily devoid of real
truth, and even of all probability. The parable reaches heights
to which the apologue cannot aspire, for the points in which
brutes and inanimate nature present analogies to man are
principally those of his lower nature, and the lessons taught
by the apologue seldom therefore reach beyond prudential
morality, whereas the parable aims at representing the relations
between man and God. It finds its framework in the world of
nature as it actually is, and not in any grotesque parody of it,
and it exhibits real and not fanciful analogies. The apologue
seizes on that which man has in common with creatures below
him, and the parable on that which he has in common with God.
Still, in spite of the difference of moral level, Martin Luther
thought so highly of apologues as counsellors of virtue that he
edited and revised Aesop and wrote a characteristic preface to
the volume. The origin of the apologue is extremely ancient
and comes from the East, which is the natural fatherland of
everything connected with allegory, metaphor and imagination.
Veiled truth was often necessary in the East, particularly with
the slaves, who dared not reveal their minds too openly. It is
noteworthy that the two fathers of apologue in the West were
slaves, namely Aesop and Phaedrus. La Fontaine in France;
Gay and Dodsley in England; Gellert, Lessing and Hagedorn
in Germany; Tomas de Iriarte in Spain, and Krilov in Russia,
are leading modern writers of apologues. Length is not an
essential matter in the definition of an apologue. Those of La
Fontaine are often very short, as, for example, &ldquo;Le Coque et
la Perle.&rdquo; On the other hand, in the romances of Reynard the
Fox we have medieval apologues arranged in cycles, and attaining
epical dimensions. An Italian fabulist, Corti, is said to
have developed an apologue of &ldquo;The Talking Animals&rdquo; to the
bulk of twenty-six cantos. La Motte, writing at a time when
this species of literature was universally admired, attributes
its popularity to the fact that it <i>ménage et flatte l&rsquo;amour-propre</i>
by inculcating virtue in an amusing manner without seeming
to dictate or insist. This was the ordinary 18th-century view
of the matter, but Rousseau contested the educational value of
instruction given in this indirect form.</p>

<div class="condensed">

history of the apologue from the earliest times until its final triumph
in France.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APOLOGY<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (from Gr. <span class="grk" title="apologia">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#945;</span>, defence), in its usual sense, an
expression of regret for something which has been wrongfully
said or done; a withdrawal or retraction of some charge or
imputation which is false. In an action for libel, the fact that
an apology has been promptly and fully made is a plea in mitigation
of damages. The apology should have the same form of
publicity as the original charge. If made publicly, the proper
form is an advertisement in a newspaper; if made within the
hearing of a few only, a letter of apology, which may be read
to those who have heard what was said, should be sufficient. By
the English Libel Act 1843, s. 2, it was enacted that in an action
for libel contained in a newspaper it is a defence for the defendant
to plead that the libel was inserted without actual malice and
without gross negligence, and that before the commencement of
the action and at the earliest opportunity afterwards he inserted
in the newspaper a full apology for the libel, or, where the newspaper
in which the libel appeared was published at intervals
exceeding one week, he offered to publish the apology in any
newspaper selected by the plaintiff. The apology must be full
and must be printed in as conspicuous a place and manner as the
libel was.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;apology&rdquo; or &ldquo;apologia&rdquo; is also used in the sense
of defence or vindication, the only meaning of the Greek
<span class="grk" title="apologia">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#945;</span>, especially of the defence of a doctrine or system, or

<p><span class="bold">APOPHYLLITE,<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> a mineral often classed with the zeolites,
since it behaves like these when heated before the blowpipe
and has the same mode of occurrence; it differs, however, from
the zeolites proper in containing no aluminium. It is a hydrous
potassium and calcium silicate, H<span class="su">7</span>KCa<span class="su">4</span>(SiO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">8</span> + 4½(H<span class="su">2</span>O). A
small amount of fluorine is often present, and it is one of the few
minerals in which ammonium has been detected. The temperature
at which the water is expelled is higher than is usually the
case with zeolites; none is given off below 200°, and only about
half at 250°; this is slowly reabsorbed again from moist air,
and is therefore regarded as water of crystallization, the remainder
being water of constitution. When heated before the blowpipe,
the mineral exfoliates, owing to loss of water, and on this account
was named apophyllite by R.J. Haüy in 1806, from the Greek
<span class="grk" title="apo">&#7936;&#960;&#959;</span>, from, and <span class="grk" title="phullon">&#966;&#973;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span>, a leaf.</p>

<p>Apophyllite always occurs as distinct crystals, which belong
to the tetragonal system. The form is either a square prism
terminated by the basal
planes (fig. 2), or an acute
pyramid (fig. 1). A prominent
feature of the mineral
is its perfect basal cleavage,
on which the lustre is
markedly pearly, presenting,
in white crystals, somewhat
the appearance of
the eye of a fish after
boiling, hence the old name
fish-eye-stone or ichthyophthalmite for the mineral. On
other surfaces the lustre is vitreous. The crystals are usually
transparent and colourless, sometimes with a greenish or
rose-red tint. Opaque white crystals of cubic habit have
been called albine; xylochlore is an olive-green variety.
The hardness is 4½, and the specific gravity 2.35.</p>

<p>The optical characters of the mineral are of special interest,
and have been much studied. The sign of the double refraction
may be either positive or negative, and some crystals are divided
into optically biaxial sectors. The variety known as leucocyclite
shows, when examined in convergent polarized light, a peculiar
interference figure, the rings being alternately white and violet-black
and not coloured as in a normal figure seen in white light.</p>

<p>Apophyllite is a mineral of secondary origin, commonly
occurring, in association with other zeolites, in amygdaloidal
cavities in basalt and melaphyre. Magnificent groups of greenish
and colourless tabular crystals, the crystals several inches
across, were found, with flesh-red stilbite, in the Deccan traps
of the Western Gháts, near Bombay, during the construction of
the Great Indian Peninsular railway. Groups of crystals of a
beautiful pink colour have been found in the silver veins of
Andreasberg in the Harz and of Guanaxuato in Mexico. Crystals
of recent formation have been detected in the Roman remains
at the hot springs of Plombières in France.</p>

to stun), the term employed by Galen to designate the &ldquo;sudden
loss of feeling and movement of the whole body, with the exception
of respiration,&rdquo; to which, after the time of Harvey, was
added &ldquo;and with the exception of the circulation.&rdquo; Although
the term is occasionally employed in medicine with other significations,
yet in its general acceptation apoplexy may be defined as a
sudden loss of consciousness, of sensibility, and of movement without
any <i>essential</i> modification of the respiratory and circulatory
functions occasioned by some brain disease. It was discovered
that the majority of the cases of apoplexy were due to cerebral
haemorrhage, and what looked like cerebral haemorrhage, red
softening; and the idea for a long time prevailed that apoplexy
and cerebral haemorrhage could be employed as synonymous
terms, and that an individual who, in popular parlance, &ldquo;had
an apoplectic stroke,&rdquo; had necessarily suffered from haemorrhage
into his brain. A small haemorrhage may not, however, cause
an apoplectic fit, nor is an apoplectic fit always caused by
haemorrhage; it may be due to sudden blocking of a large
vessel by a clot from a distant part (embolism), or by a sudden
clotting of the blood in the vessel itself (thrombosis). Owing
to the prevailing idea in former times that cerebral haemorrhage
and apoplexy were synonymous terms, the word apoplexy was
applied to haemorrhage into other organs than the brain; thus
the terms pulmonary apoplexy, retinal apoplexy and splenic
apoplexy were used.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;apoplexy&rdquo; is now used in clinical medicine to
denote that form of coma or deep state of unconsciousness
which is due to sudden disturbance of the cerebral circulation
occasioned by a local cause within the cranial cavity, as distinct
from the loss of consciousness due to sudden failure of the
heart&rsquo;s action (syncope) or the coma of narcotic or alcoholic
poisoning, of <i>status epilepticus</i>, of uraemia or of head injury.</p>

<p>The sudden coma of sunstroke and heat-stroke might be
included, although owing to the suddenness with which a
person may be struck down, the term <i>heat apoplexy</i> is frequently
used, and, from an etymological point of view, quite justifiably.
The older writers use the term <i>simple apoplexy</i> for a sudden
attack which could not be explained by any visible disease.
Again, <i>congestive apoplexy</i> was applied to those cases of coma
where, at the autopsy, nothing was found to account for the
coma and death except engorgement of the vessels of the brain
and its membranes. In senile dementia and in general paralysis
the brain is shrunken and the convolutions atrophied, the
increased space in the ventricles and between the convolutions
being filled up with the cerebro-spinal fluid. In these diseases
apoplectic states may arise, terminating fatally; the excess of
fluid found in such cases was formerly thought to be the cause
of the symptoms, consequently the condition was called <i>serous
apoplexy</i>. Such terms are no longer used, owing to the better
knowledge of the pathology of brain disease.</p>

<p>Having thus narrowed down the application of the term
&ldquo;apoplexy,&rdquo; we are in a position to consider its chief features,
and the mechanism by which it is produced. Apoplexy may be
rapidly fatal, but it is very seldom <i>instantly</i> fatal. The onset is
usually sudden, and sometimes the individual may be struck
down in an instant, senseless and motionless, &ldquo;warranting those
epithets, which the ancients applied to the victims of this
disease, of <i>attoniti</i> and <i>siderati</i>, as if they were thunder-stricken
or planet-struck&rdquo; (Sir Thomas Watson). The attack, however,
may be less sudden and, not infrequently, attended by a convulsion;
while occasionally, in the condition termed <i>ingravescent
apoplexy</i>, the coma is gradual in its onset, occupying hours in its
development. Although unexpected, various warning symptoms,
sometimes slight, sometimes pronounced, occur in the majority
of cases. Such are, fulness in the head, headache, giddiness,
noises in the ears, mental confusion, slight lapses of consciousness,
numbness or tingling in the limbs. A characteristic apoplectic
attack presents the following phenomena: the individual falls
down suddenly and lies without sense or motion, except that
his pulse keeps beating and his breathing continues. He
appears to be in a deep sleep, from which he cannot be roused;
the breathing is laboured and stertorous, and is accompanied
with puffing out of the cheeks; the pulse may be beating more
strongly than natural, and the face is often flushed and turgid.
The reflexes are abolished. Although apoplexy may occur without
paralysis, and paralysis without apoplexy, the two, owning
the same cause, very frequently co-exist, or happen in immediate
sequence and connexion; consequently there is in most cases
definite evidence of paralysis affecting usually one side of the
body in addition to the coma. Thus the pupils are unequal;
there may be asymmetry of the face, or the limbs may be more
rigid or flaccid on one side than on the other. These signs of
localized disease enable a distinction to be made from the coma
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
of narcotic poisoning and alcoholic intoxication. It must be
borne in mind that a person smelling strongly of liquor and
found lying in the street in a comatose state may be suffering
from apoplexy, and the error of sending a dying man to a police
cell may be avoided by this knowledge.</p>

<p>If the fit is only moderately severe, the reflexes soon return, and
the patient may in a few hours show indications of returning
consciousness by making some movements or opening his eyes
when spoken to, although later it may be found that he is
unable to speak, or may be paralysed or mentally afflicted (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paralysis</a></span>). In severe cases the coma deepens and the patient
dies, usually from interference with the breathing, or, less
commonly, from arrest of the heart&rsquo;s action.</p>

<p>The mechanism by which apoplexy is produced has been a
matter of much dispute; the condition was formerly ascribed
to the pressure exerted by the clot on the rest of the brain, but
there is no increase of intracranial pressure in an apoplectic fit
occurring as a result of the sudden closure of a large vessel by
embolism or thrombosis. Suddenness of the lesion appears to
be, then, the essential element common to all cases of apoplexy
from organic brain disease. It is the sudden shock to the delicate
mechanism that produces the unconsciousness; but seeing that
the coma is usually deeper and more prolonged in cerebral
haemorrhage than when occasioned by vascular occlusion, and
that an ingravescent apoplexy coma gradually develops and
deepens as the amount of haemorrhage increases, we may presume
that increase of intracranial pressure does play an important
part in the degree and intensity of the coma caused by the
rupture of a vessel. Apoplexy seldom occurs under forty years
of age, but owing to the fact that disease of the cerebral vessels
may exist at any age, from causes which are fully explained in
the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Neuropathology</a></span>, no period of life is exempt;
consequently cases of true apoplexy are not wanting even in
very young children. Recognizing that there are two causes of
apoplexy in advanced life, viz. (1) sudden rupture of a diseased
vessel usually associated with high arterial pressure, enlarged,
powerfully acting heart and chronic renal disease, and (2) the
sudden clotting of blood in a large diseased vessel favoured by a
low arterial pressure due to a weak-acting heart, it is obvious
that the character of the pulse forms a good guide to the diagnosis
of the cause, the prevention and warding off of an attack, and
the treatment of such should it occur.</p>

<p>Anything which tends directly or indirectly to increase
arterial pressure within the cerebral blood-vessels may bring
on an attack of cerebral haemorrhage; and although the
identification of an apoplectic habit of body with a stout build,
a short neck and florid complexion is now generally discredited,
it being admitted that apoplexy occurs as frequently in thin
and spare persons who present no such peculiarity of conformation,
yet a plethoric habit of body, occasioned by immoderate
eating or drinking associated with the gouty diathesis, leads to a
general arterio-sclerosis and high arterial pressure. All conditions
which can give rise to a local intracranial or a general
bodily increase of the arterial pressure, <i>i.e.</i> severe exertion of
body and mind, violent emotions, much stooping, overheated
rooms, exposure to the sun, sudden shocks to the body, constipation
and straining at stool, may, by suddenly increasing the
strain on the wall of a diseased vessel, lead to its rupture.</p>

<p>The outlook of apoplexy is generally unfavourable in cases
where the coma is profound; death may take place at different
intervals after the onset. If the patient, after recovering from
the initial coma, suffers with continual headache and lapses
into a drowsy state, the result is likely to be serious; for such a
condition probably indicates that an inflammatory change has
taken place about the clot or in the area of softening.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The patient should be placed in the recumbent
position with the head and shoulders slightly raised. He should
be moved as little as possible from the place where the attack
occurred. The medical man who is summoned will probably
give the following directions: an ice-bag to be applied to the
head; a few grains of calomel or a drop of croton oil in butter
to be placed on the tongue, or an enema of castor oil to be
administered. He may find it necessary to draw off the water
with a catheter. The practice of blood-letting, once so common
in this disease, is seldom resorted to, although in some cases,
where there is very high arterial tension and a general state of
plethora, it might be beneficial. Depletives are not employed
where there is evidence of failure of the heart&rsquo;s action; indeed
the cautious administration of stimulants may be necessary,
either subcutaneously or by the mouth (if there exist a power of
swallowing), together with warm applications to the surface of
the body; a water-bed may be required, and careful nursing, is
essential to prevent complications, especially the formation of
bedsores.</p>

<span class="grk" title="presbentas">&#960;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#946;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#962;</span>), a technical term used in the New Testament and in
Christian literature generally for a special envoy of Jesus Christ.
How far it had any similar use in Judaism in Christ&rsquo;s day is
uncertain; but in the 4th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, at any rate, it denoted
responsible envoys from the central Jewish authority, especially
for the collection of religious funds. In its first and simplest
Christian form, the idea is present already in Mark iii. 14 f.,
where from the general circle of his disciples Jesus &ldquo;made
twelve (&lsquo;whom he also named apostles,&rsquo; Luke vi. 13, but
doubtful in Mark), that they should be with him, and that he
might from time to time send them forth (<span class="grk" title="hina apostellae">&#7989;&#957;&#945; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#8131;</span>) to
preach and to have authority to cast out demons.&rdquo; Later on
(vi. 6 ff.), in connexion with systematic preaching among the
villages of Galilee, Jesus begins actually to &ldquo;send forth&rdquo; the
twelve, two by two; and on their return from this mission
(vi. 30) they are for the first time described as &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; or
missionary envoys. Matthew (x. 1 ff.) blends the calling of the
twelve with their actual sending forth, while Luke (vi. 13)
makes Jesus himself call them &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; (for Luke&rsquo;s usage
cf. xi. 49, &ldquo;prophets and apostles,&rdquo; where Matthew, xxiii. 34,
has &ldquo;prophets and wise men and scribes&rdquo;). But it is doubtful
whether Jesus ever used the term for the Twelve, in relation to
their temporary missions, any more than for the &ldquo;seventy
others&rdquo; whom he &ldquo;sent forth&rdquo; later (Luke x. 1). Even the
Fourth Gospel never so describes them. It simply has &ldquo;a
servant is not greater than his lord, neither an apostle (envoy)
greater than he that sent him&rdquo; (xiii. 16); and applies the idea
of &ldquo;mission&rdquo; alike to Jesus (cf. Heb. iii. 1, &ldquo;Jesus, the apostle ... of
our profession&rdquo;) and to his disciples, generally, as
represented by the Twelve (xvii. 18, with 3, 6 ff.). But while
ideally all Christ&rsquo;s disciples were &ldquo;sent&rdquo; with the Father&rsquo;s
Name in charge, there were different degrees in which this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
applied in practice; and so we find &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; used in several
senses, once it emerges as a technical term.</p>

<p>1. In the Apostolic age itself, &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; often denotes
simply an &ldquo;envoy,&rdquo; commissioned by Jesus Christ to be a
primary witness and preacher of the Messianic Kingdom. This
wide sense was shown by Lightfoot (in his commentary on
<i>Galatians</i>, 1865) to exist in the New Testament, <i>e.g.</i> in 1 Cor.
xii. 28 f., Eph. iv. ii, Rom. xvi. 7; and his view has since been
emphasized<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> by the discovery of the <i>Teaching of the Twelve
Apostles</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Didache</a></span>), with its itinerant order of &ldquo;apostles,&rdquo;
who, together with &ldquo;prophets&rdquo; (cf. Eph. ii. 20, iii. 5) and
&ldquo;teachers,&rdquo; constituted a <i>charismatic</i> and seemingly unordained
ministry of the Word, in some part of the Church (in Syria?)
during the early sub-apostolic age. Paul is our earliest witness,
as just cited; also in 1 Cor. xv. 5 ff., where he seems to quote the
language of Palestinian tradition, in saying that Christ &ldquo;appeared
to Cephas; then to the Twelve; then ... to James; then to
the apostles one and all (<span class="grk" title="tois apostolois pasin">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span>); and last of all ... to
me also.&rdquo; The appearance to &ldquo;<i>all</i> the Apostles&rdquo; must
refer to the final commission given by the risen Christ to certain
assembled disciples (Acts i. 6 ff., cf. Luke xxiv. 33), including not
only the Twelve and the Lord&rsquo;s brethren (i. 13 f.), but also some
at least of the Seventy. Of this wider circle of witnesses, taken
from among personal disciples during Jesus&rsquo;s earthly ministry,
we get a further glimpse in the election of one from their number
to fill Judas&rsquo;s place among the Twelve (i. 21 ff.), as the primary
official witnesses of Messiah and his resurrection. Many of the
120 then present (Acts i. 15), and not only the two set forward
for final choice, must have been personal disciples, who by the
recent commission had been made &ldquo;apostles.&rdquo; Among such we
may perhaps name Judas Barsabbas and Silas (Acts xv. 22, cf.
i. 23), if not also Barnabas (1 Cor. ix. 6) and Andronicus and
Junia (Rom. xvi. 7).</p>

<p>So far, then, we gather that the original Palestinian type of
apostleship meant simply (a) personal mission from the risen
Christ (cf. I Cor. ix. i), following on (b) some preliminary intercourse with Jesus in his earthly ministry. It was pre-eminence
in the latter qualification that gave the Twelve their special
status among apostles (Acts i. 26, ii. 14, vi. 2; in Acts generally
they are simply &ldquo;the apostles&rdquo;). Conversely, it was Paul&rsquo;s
lack in this respect which lay at the root of his difficulties as an
apostle.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It is possible, though not certain, that even those Judaizing
missionaries at Corinth whom Paul styles &ldquo;false-apostles&rdquo; or,
ironically, &ldquo;the superlative apostles&rdquo; (2 Cor. xi. 5, 13; xii. 11),
rested part of their claim to superiority over Paul on (<i>b</i>), possibly
even as having done service to Christ when on earth (2 Cor. xi. 18, 23).
There is no sign in 2 Cor. that they laid claim to (<i>a</i>). If this be
so, they were &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s apostles&rdquo; only indirectly, &ldquo;through men&rdquo;
(as some had alleged touching Paul, cf. Gal. i. 1), <i>i.e.</i> as sent forth
on mission work by certain Jerusalem leaders with letters of introduction
(2 Cor. iii. 1; E. von Dobschutz, <i>Problems der apost. Zeitalters</i>,
p. 106).</p>
</div>

<p>2. <i>The Twelve.</i>&mdash;When Jesus selected an inner circle of
disciples for continuous training by personal intercourse, his
choice of &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; had direct reference to the tribes of Israel
(Matt. xix. 28; Luke xxii. 30). This gave them a symbolic or
representative character as a closed body (cf. Rev. xxi. 14),
marking them off as the primary religious authority (cf. Acts
ii. 42, &ldquo;the apostles&rsquo; teaching&rdquo;) among the &ldquo;disciples&rdquo; or
&ldquo;brethren,&rdquo; when these began to assume the form of a community
or church. The relationship which other &ldquo;apostles&rdquo;
had enjoyed with the Master had been uncertain; <i>they</i> had been
his recognized intimates, and that as a body. Naturally, then,
they took the lead, collectively&mdash;in form at least, though really
the initiative lay with one or two of their own number, Peter in
particular. The process of practical differentiation from their
fellow apostles was furthered by the concentration of the Twelve,
or at least of its most marked representatives, in Jerusalem,
for a considerable period (Acts viii. 1, cf. xii. 1 ff.; an early
tradition specifies twelve years). Other apostles soon went forth
on their mission to &ldquo;the cities of Israel&rdquo; (cf. Acts ix. 31), and
so exercised but little influence on the central policy of the
Church. Hence their shadowy existence in the New Testament,
though the actual wording of Matt. x. 5-42, read in the light of
the <i>Didachi</i>, may help us to conceive their work in its main
features.</p>

<p>3. &ldquo;<i>Pillar</i>&rdquo; <i>Apostles.</i>&mdash;But in fact differentiation between
apostles existed among the Twelve also. There were &ldquo;pillars,&rdquo;
like Peter and John (and his brother James until his death),
who really determined matters of grave moment, as in the
conference with Paul in Gal. ii. 9&mdash;a conference which laid the
basis of the latter&rsquo;s status as an apostle even in the eyes of
Jewish Christians. Such pre-eminence was but the sequel of
personal distinctions visible even in the preparatory days of
discipleship, and it warns us against viewing the primitive facts
touching apostles in the official light of later times.</p>

<p>Consciousness of such personal pre-eminence has left its marks
on the lists of the Twelve in the New Testament. Thus (1)
Peter, James, John, Andrew, always appear as the first four,
though the order varies, Mark representing relative prominence
during Christ&rsquo;s ministry, and Acts actual influence in the Apostolic
Church (cf. Luke viii. 51, ix. 28). (2) The others also stand
in groups of four, the first name in each being constant, while the
order of the rest varies.</p>

<p>The same lesson emerges when we note that one such apostolic
&ldquo;pillar&rdquo; stood outside the Twelve altogether, viz. James, the
Lord&rsquo;s brother (Gal. ii. 9, cf. i. 19); and further, that &ldquo;the
Lord&rsquo;s brethren&rdquo; seem to have ranked above &ldquo;apostles&rdquo;
generally, being named between them and Peter in 1 Cor. ix. 5.
That is, they too were apostles with the addition of a certain
personal distinction.</p>

<p>4. <i>Paul, the</i> &ldquo;<i>Apostle of the Gentiles.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;So far apostles are
only of the Palestinian type, taken from among actual hearers
of the Messiah and with a mission primarily to Jews&mdash;apostles
&ldquo;of the circumcision&rdquo; (Gal. ii. 7-9). Now, however, emerges a
new apostleship, that to the Gentiles; and with the change of
mission goes also some change in the type of missionary or
apostle. Of this type Paul was the first, and he remained its
primary, and in some senses its only, example. Though he
could claim, on occasion, to satisfy the old test of having seen
the risen Lord (1 Cor. ix. 1, cf. xv. 8), he himself laid stress not
on this, but on the revelation within his own soul of Jesus as
God&rsquo;s Son, and of the Gospel latent therein (Gal. i. 16). This
was his divine call as &ldquo;apostle of the Gentiles&rdquo; (Rom. xi. 13);
here lay both his qualification and his credentials, once the fruits
of the divine inworking were manifest in the success of his
missionary work (Gal. ii. 8 f.; 1 Cor. xi. 1 f.; 2 Cor. in. 2 f., xii. 12).
But this new criterion of apostleship was capable of wider
application, one dispensing altogether with vision of the risen
Lord&mdash;which could not even in Paul&rsquo;s case be proved so fully
as in the case of the original apostles&mdash;but appealing to the
&ldquo;signs of an apostle&rdquo; (1 Cor. ix. 2; 2 Cor. xii. 12), the tokens of
spiritual gift visible in work done, and particularly in the planting
of the Gospel in fresh fields (2 Cor. x. 14-18). It may be in this
wide charismatic sense that Paul uses the term in 1 Cor. xii. 28 f.,
Eph. ii. 20, iii. 5, iv. 11, and especially in Rom. xvi. 7, &ldquo;men of
mark among the apostles&rdquo; (cf. 2 Cor. xi. 13, &ldquo;pseudo-apostles&rdquo;
masquerading as &ldquo;apostles of Christ,&rdquo; and perhaps 1 Thess. ii, 6,
of himself and Silas). That he used it in senses differing with
the context is proved by 1 Cor. xv. 9, where he styles himself
&ldquo;the least of apostles,&rdquo; although in other connexions he claims
the very highest rank, co-ordinate even with the Twelve as a
body (Gal. ii. 7 ff.), in virtue of his distinctive Gospel.</p>

<p>This point of view was not widely shared even in circles
appreciative of his actual work. To most he seemed but a
fruitful worker within lines determined by &ldquo;the twelve apostles
of the Lamb&rdquo; as a body (Rev. xxi. 14). So we read of &ldquo;the
plant (Church) which the twelve apostles of the Beloved shall
plant&rdquo; (<i>Ascension of Isaiah</i>, iv. 3); &ldquo;those who preached the
Gospel to us (especially Gentiles)... unto whom He gave
authority over the Gospel, being twelve for a witness to the
tribes&rdquo; (Barn. viii. 3, cf. v. 9); and the going forth of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
Twelve, after twelve years, beyond Palestine &ldquo;into the world,&rdquo;
to give it a chance to hear (<i>Preaching of Peter</i>, in Clem. Alex.
<i>Strom.</i> vi. 5.43; 6.48). Later on, however, his own claim told
on the Church&rsquo;s mind, when his epistles were read in church as a
collection styled simply &ldquo;the Apostle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the primary medium of the Gentile Gospel (Gal. i. 16, cf.
i. 8, ii. 2) Paul had no peers as an &ldquo;apostle of the Gentiles&rdquo;
(Rom. xi. 13, cf. XV. 15-20, and see 1 Cor. xv. 8, &ldquo;last of all to
me&rdquo;), unless it were Barnabas who shares with him the title
&ldquo;apostle&rdquo; in Acts xiv. 4, 14&mdash;possibly with reference to the
special &ldquo;work&rdquo; on which they had recently been &ldquo;sent forth
by the Spirit&rdquo; (xiii. 2, 4). Yet such as shared the spiritual gift
(<i>charisma</i>) of missionary power in sufficient degree, were in fact
apostles of Christ in the Spirit (1 Cor. xii. 28, II). Such a
secondary type of apostolate&mdash;answering to &ldquo;apostolic missionaries&rdquo;
of later times (cf. the use of <span class="grk" title="hierapostolos">&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#972;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> in this sense by
the Orthodox Eastern Church to-day)&mdash;would help to account
for the apostolic claims of the missionaries censured in Rev. ii. 2,
as also for the &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; of the second generation implied in
the Didach&#275;.</p>

<p>In the <i>sub-apostolic age</i>, however, the class of &ldquo;missionaries&rdquo;
enjoying a <i>charisma</i> such as was conceived to convey apostolic
commission through the Spirit, soon became distinguished from
&ldquo;apostles&rdquo; (cf. Hennas, <i>Sim.</i> ix. 15.4, &ldquo;the apostles and teachers
of the message of the Son of God,&rdquo; so 25.2; in 17.1 the apostles
are reckoned as twelve), as the title became more and more
confined by usage to the original apostles, particularly the
Twelve as a body (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Ascension of Isaiah</i> and the <i>Preaching of
Peter</i>), or to them and Paul (<i>e.g.</i> in Clement and Ignatius), and
as reverence for these latter grew in connexion with their story
in the Gospels and in Acts.<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Thus Eusebius describes as &ldquo;evangelists&rdquo;
(cf. Philip the Evangelist in Acts xxi. 8, also Eph. iv. 11,
2 Tim. iv. 5) those who &ldquo;occupied the first rank in the succession
to the Apostles&rdquo; in missionary work (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i> iii. 37, cf. v. 10).
Yet the wider sense of &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; did not at once die out even
in the third and fourth generations. It lingered on as applied
to the Seventy<a name="fa3c" id="fa3c" href="#ft3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a>&mdash;by Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement and Origen&mdash;
and even to Clement of Rome, by Clem. Alex. (? as a &ldquo;fellow-worker&rdquo;
of Paul, Phil. iv. 3); while the adjective &ldquo;apostolic&rdquo;
was applied to men like Polycarp (in his contemporary <i>Acts of
Martyrdom</i>) and the Phrygian, Alexander, martyred at Lyons in
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 177 (Eus. v. 1), who was &ldquo;not without share of apostolic
<i>charisma</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>authority</i> attaching to apostles was essentially spiritual in
character and in the conditions of its exercise. Anything like
autocracy among his followers was alien to Jesus&rsquo;s own teaching
(Matt, xxiii. 6-11). All Christians were &ldquo;brethren,&rdquo; and the
basis of pre-eminence among them was relative ability for service.
But the personal relation of the original Palestinian apostles to
Jesus himself as Master gave them a unique fitness as authorized
witnesses, from which flowed naturally, by sheer spiritual influence,
such special forms of authority as they came gradually
to exercise in the early Church. &ldquo;There is no trace in Scripture
of a formal commission of authority for government from Christ
Himself&rdquo; (Hort, <i>Chr. Eccl.</i> p. 84) given to apostles, save as
representing the brethren in their collective action. Even the
&ldquo;resolutions&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="dogmata">&#948;&#972;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>) of the Jerusalem conference were not
set forth by the apostles present simply in their own name, nor
as <i>ipso facto</i> binding on the conscience of the Antiochene Church.
They expressed &ldquo;a claim to deference rather than a right to be
obeyed&rdquo; (Hort, <i>op. cit.</i> 81-85). Such was the kind of authority
attaching to apostles, whether collectively or individually. It
was not a fixed notion, but varied in quantity and quality with
the growing maturity of converts. This is how Paul, from whom
we gather most on the point, conceives the matter. The exercise
of his spiritual authority is not absolute, lest he &ldquo;lord it over
their faith&rdquo;; consent of conscience or of &ldquo;faith&rdquo; is ever requisite
(2 Cor. i. 24; cf. Rom. xiv. 23). But the principle was elastic in
application, and would take more patriarchal forms in Palestine
than in the Greek world. The case was essentially the same as
on the various mission-fields to-day, where the position of the
&ldquo;missionary&rdquo; is at first one of great spiritual initiative and
authority, limited only by his own sense of the fitness of things,
in the light of local usages. So the notion of formal or constitutional
authority attaching to the apostolate, in its various senses,
is an anachronism for the apostolic age. The tendency, however,
was for their authority to be conceived more and more on formal
lines, and, particularly after their deaths, as absolute.</p>

<p>The authority attaching to apostles as writers, which led
gradually to the formation of a New Testament Canon&mdash;&ldquo;the
Apostles&rdquo; side by side with &ldquo;the Books&rdquo; of the Old Testament
(so 2 Clement xiv., <i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 120-140)&mdash;is a subject by itself (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bible</a></span>).</p>

<p>This change of conception helped to further the notion of a
certain devolution of apostolic powers to successors constituted
by act of ordination. The earliest idea of an <i>apostolical succession</i>
meant simply the re-emergence in others of the apostolic spirit of
missionary enthusiasm. &ldquo;The first rank in the succession of the
apostles&rdquo; consisted of men eminent as disciples of theirs, and so
fitted to continue their labours (Euseb. iii. 37); and even under
Commodus (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 180-193) there were &ldquo;evangelists of the word&rdquo;
possessed of &ldquo;inspired zeal to emulate apostles&rdquo; (v. 10). Such
were perhaps the &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; of the <i>Didach&#275;</i>. Of the notion of
apostolic succession in ministerial grace conferred by ordination,
there is little or no trace before Irenaeus. The famous passage
in Clement of Rome (xliv. 2) refers simply to the succession of
one set of men to another in an office of apostolic institution.
The grace that makes Polycarp &ldquo;an apostolic and prophetic
teacher&rdquo; (<i>Mart. Polyc.</i> 16) is peculiar to him personally. But
Irenaeus holds, apparently on <i>a priori</i> grounds, that &ldquo;elders&rdquo;
who stand in orderly succession to the apostolic founders of the
true tradition in the churches, have, &ldquo;along with the succession
of oversight,&rdquo; also an &ldquo;assured gift of (insight into) truth&rdquo;
by the Father&rsquo;s good pleasure (&ldquo;cum episcopatus successione
charisma veritatis certum secundum placitum Patris
acceperunt&rdquo;), in contrast to heretics who wilfully stand outside
this approved line of transmission (<i>adv. Haer.</i> iv. 26. 2). So far,
indeed, the succession is not limited to the monarchical episcopate
as distinct from the presbyteral order to which it belonged (cf.
&ldquo;presbyterii ordo, principalis consessio&rdquo; in the same context,
and see iii. 14. 2), though the bishops of apostolic churches, as
capable of being traced individually (iii. 3. 1), are specially
appealed to as witnesses (cf. iv. 33. 8, v. 19. 2)&mdash;as earlier by
Hegesippus (Euseb. iv. 22). Nor is there mention of sacerdotal
grace attaching to the succession in apostolic truth.<a name="fa4c" id="fa4c" href="#ft4c"><span class="sp">4</span></a> But once
the idea of supernatural grace going along with office as such
(of which we have already a trace in the Ignatian bishop, though
without the notion of actual apostolic succession) arose in connexion
with <i>successio ab apostolis</i>, the full development of the
doctrine was but a matter of time.<a name="fa5c" id="fa5c" href="#ft5c"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

regulations in eight books, the last of which concludes with the
eighty-five <i>Canons of the Holy Apostles</i>. By their title the Constitutions
profess to have been drawn up by the apostles, and
to have been transmitted to the Church by Clement of Rome;
sometimes the alleged authors are represented as speaking
jointly, sometimes singly. From the first they have been very
variously estimated; the <i>Canons</i>, as a rule, more highly than the
rest of the work. For example, the Trullan Council of Constantinople
(<i>quini-sextum</i>), <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 692, accepts the Canons as genuine by
its second canon, but rejects the Constitutions on the ground
that spurious matter had been introduced into them by heretics;
and whilst the former were henceforward used freely in the East,
only a few portions of the latter found their way into the Greek
and oriental law-books. Again, Dionysius Exiguus (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 500)
translated fifty of the Canons into Latin,<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> although under the
title <i>Canones qui dicuntur Apostolorum</i>, and thus they passed
into other Western collections; whilst the Constitutions as a
whole remained unknown in the West until they were published
in 1563 by the Jesuit Turrianus. At first received with enthusiasm,
their authenticity soon came to be impugned; and
their true significance was largely lost sight of as it began to be
realized that they were not what they claimed to be. Vain
attempts were still made to rehabilitate them, and they were,
in general, more highly estimated in England than elsewhere.
The most extravagant estimate of all was that of Whiston, who
calls them &ldquo;the most sacred standard of Christianity, equal in
authority to the Gospels themselves, and superior in authority
to the epistles of single apostles, some parts of them being our
Saviour&rsquo;s own original laws delivered to the apostles, and the
other parts the public acts of the apostles&rdquo; (Historical preface
to <i>Primitive Christianity Revived</i>, pp. 85-86). Others, however,
realized their composite character from the first, and by degrees
some of the component documents became known. Bishop
Pearson was able to say that &ldquo;the eight books of the Apostolic
Constitutions have been after Epiphanius&rsquo;s time compiled and
patched together out of the <i>didascaliae</i> or doctrines which went
under the names of the holy apostles and their disciples or successors&rdquo; (<i>Vind. Ign.</i> i. cap. 5); whilst a greater scholar still,
Archbishop Usher, had already gone much further, and concluded,
forestalling the results of modern critical methods, that
their compiler was none other than the compiler of the spurious
Ignatian epistles (<i>Epp. Polyc. et Ign.</i> p. lxiii. f., Oxon. 1644).
The Apostolical Constitutions, then, are spurious, and they are
one of a long series of documents of like character. But we
have not really gauged their significance by saying that they
are spurious. They are the last stage and climax of a gradual
process of compilation and crystallization, so to speak, of unwritten
church custom; and a short account of this process will
show their real importance and value.</p>

<p>These documents are the outcome of a tendency which is
found in every society, religious or secular, at some point in its
history. The society begins by living in accordance
with its fundamental principles. By degrees these
<span class="sidenote">Origin and real nature.</span>
translate themselves into appropriate action. Difficulties
are faced and solved as they arise; and when
similar circumstances recur they will tend to be met in the
same way. Thus there grows up by degrees a body of what
may be called customary law. Plainly, there is no particular
point of time at which this customary law can be said to have
begun. To all appearance it is there from the first in solution
and gradually crystallizes out; and yet it is being continually
modified as time goes on. Moreover, the time comes when
the attempt is made, either by private individuals or by the
society itself, to put this &ldquo;customary law&rdquo; into writing. Now
when this is done, two tendencies will at once show themselves.
(<i>a</i>) This &ldquo;customary law&rdquo; will at once become more definite:
the very fact of putting it into writing will involve an effort
after logical completeness. There will be a tendency on the part
of the writer to fill up gaps; to state local customs as if they
obtained universally; to introduce his personal equation, and
to add to that which is the custom that which, in his opinion,
<i>ought</i> to be. (<i>b</i>) There will be a strong tendency to fortify that
which has been written with great names, especially in days
when there is no very clear notion of literary property. This is
done, not always with any deliberate consciousness of fraud
(although it must be clearly recognized that truth is not one of
the &ldquo;natural virtues,&rdquo; and that the sense of the obligations of
truthfulness was far from strong), but rather to emphasize the
importance of what was written, and the fact that it was no
new invention of the writer&rsquo;s. In a non-literary age fame
gathers about great names; and that which, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, has
gone on since the beginning of things is naturally attributed to
the founders of the society. Then come interpolations to make
this ascription more probable, and the prefixing of a title, then
or subsequently, which states it as a fact. This is precisely the
way in which the Apostolical Constitutions and other kindred
documents have come into being. They are attempts, made in
various places and at different times, to put into writing the
order and discipline and character of the Church; in part for
private instruction and edification, but in part also with a view
to actual use; frequently even with an actual reference to
particular circumstances. In this lies their importance, to a
degree which is only just being adequately realized. They
contain evidence of the utmost value as to the order of the
Church in early days; evidence, however, which needs to be
sifted with the greatest care, since the personal preferences of
the writer and the customs of the local church to which he belongs
are continually mixed up with things which have a wider prevalence.
It is only by careful investigation, by the method of
comparisons, that these elements can be disentangled; but as
the number of documents of this class known to us is continually
increasing, their value increases even more than proportionately.
And whilst their local and fugitive character must be fully
recognized and allowed for, is it unjustifiable to set them aside
or leave them out of account as heretical, and therefore negligible.</p>

<p>It will be sufficient here to mention shortly the chief collections
of this kind which came into existence during the first four
centuries; generally as the work of private individuals,
and having, at any rate, no more than a local authority
<span class="sidenote">Other collections.</span>
of some kind, (<i>a</i>) The earliest known to us is the
<i>Didach&#275;</i> or <i>Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</i>, itself compiled from
earlier materials, and dating from about 120 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Didach&#275;</a></span>).
(<i>b</i>) <i>The Apostolic Church Order</i> (<i>apostolische Kirchenordnung</i> of
German writers); <i>Ecclesiastical Canons of the Holy Apostles</i> of
one MS.; <i>Sententiae Apostolorum</i> of Pitra: of about 300, and
emanating probably from Asia Minor. Its earlier part, cc. 1-14,
depends upon the <i>Didach&#275;</i>, and the rest of it is a book of discipline
in which Harnack has attempted to distinguish two older fragments
of church law (<i>Texte u. Unters</i>. ii. 5). (<i>c</i>) The so-called
<i>Canones Hippolyti</i>, probably Alexandrian or Roman, and of the
first half of the 3rd century. It will be observed that these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>200</span>
make no claim to apostolic authorship; but otherwise their
origin is like that of the rest, unless indeed, as has been suggested,
they represent the work of an actual Roman synod, (<i>d</i>) The
so-called <i>Egyptian Church Order</i>, in Coptic from a Greek pre-Nicene
original (<i>c</i>. 310). It is part of the Egyptian Heptateuch
and contains neither communion nor ordination forms, (<i>e</i>) The
<i>Ethiopic Church Order</i>, perhaps twenty years later than (<i>d</i>), and
forming part of the <i>Ethiopic Statutes</i>. (<i>f</i>) The <i>Verona Latin
Fragments</i>, discovered and published by Hauler, portions of
a form akin to (<i>e</i>), which may be dated <i>c</i>. 340, though possibly
earlier. It has a preface which refers to a treatise <i>Concerning
Spiritual Gifts</i> as having immediately preceded it. (<i>g</i>) The
recently discovered <i>Testament of the Lord</i>, which is somewhat
later in date (<i>c.</i> 350), and likewise depends upon the <i>Canones
Hippolyti</i>. (<i>h</i>) The so-called <i>Canons of Basil</i>. This is an Arabic
work perhaps based on a Coptic and ultimately on a Greek
original, embodying with modifications large portions of the
Canons of Hippolytus. (On the relations between the six last-named,
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hippolytus, Canons of</a></span>.)</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Here also may be noticed the <i>Didascalia Apostolorum</i>, originally
written in Greek, but known through a Syriac version and a fragmentary
Latin one published by Hauler. It is of the middle of the
3rd century&mdash;in fact, a passage in the Latin translation seems to give
us the date <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 254. It emanates from Palestine or Syria, and is
independent of the documents already mentioned; and upon it the
<i>Constitutions</i> themselves very largely depend. It is a mixture of
moral and ecclesiastical instruction. The <i>Sacramentary of Serapion</i>
(<i>c.</i> 350), <i>The Pilgrimage of Etheria</i> (<i>Silvia</i>) (<i>c</i>. 385), and <i>The Catechetical
Lectures of Cyril of Jerusalem</i> (348) are also of value in this
connexion. In the (so-called) <i>Constitutions through Hippolytus</i> we
have possibly a preliminary draft of the famous 8th book of the
<i>Apostolical Constitutions</i>.<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>
</div>

<p>The Constitutions themselves fall into three main divisions.
(i.) The first of these consists of books i.-vi., and throughout runs
parallel to the <i>Didascalia</i>. Bickell, indeed, held that
this latter was an abbreviated form of books i.-vi.;
<span class="sidenote">Contents.</span>
but it is now agreed on all hands that the Constitutions are based
on the <i>Didascalia</i> and not vice versa. (ii.) Then follows book vii.,
the first thirty-one chapters of which are an adaptation of the
<i>Didach&#275;</i>, whilst the rest contain various liturgical forms of which
the origin is still uncertain, though it has been acutely suggested
by Achelis, and with great probability, that they originated in
the schismatical congregation of Lucian at Antioch. (iii.) Book
viii. is more composite, and falls into three parts. The first two
chapters, <span class="grk" title="peri charismatôn">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;</span>, may be based upon a lost work of
St Hippolytus, otherwise known only by a reference to it in the
preface of the <i>Verona Latin Fragments</i>; and an examination
shows that this is highly probable. The next section, cc. 3-27,
<span class="grk" title="peri cheirotoyioy">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#967;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#8182;&#957;</span>, and cc. 28-46, <span class="grk" title="peri kayoyoy">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span>, is twofold, and
is evidently that upon which the writer sets most store. The
apostles no longer speak jointly, but one by one in an apostolic
council, and the section closes with a joint decree of them all.
They speak of the ordination of bishops (the so-called Clementine
Liturgy is that which is directed to be used at the consecration
of a bishop, cc. 5-15), of presbyters, deacons, deaconesses, sub-deacons
and lectors, and then pass on to confessors, virgins,
widows and exorcists; after which follows a series of canons on
various subjects, and liturgical formulae. With regard to this
section, all that can be said is that it includes materials which
are also to be found elsewhere&mdash;in the <i>Egyptian Church Order</i>
and other documents already spoken of&mdash;and that the precise
relation between them is at present not determined. The third
section consists of the Apostolic Canons already referred to, the
last and most significant of which places the Constitutions and
the two epistles of Clement in the canon of Scripture, and omits
the Apocalypse. They are derived in part from the preceding
Constitutions, in part from the canons of the councils of Antioch,
341, Nicaea, 325, and possibly Laodicaea, 363.</p>

<p>A comparison of the Constitutions with the material upon
which they are based will illustrate the compiler&rsquo;s method.
(<i>a</i>) To begin with the <i>Didascalia</i> already mentioned. It is unmethodical
and badly digested, homiletical in style, and abounding
in biblical quotations. There is no precise arrangement;
but the subjects, following a general introduction, are the bishop
and his duties, penance, the administration of the offerings,
the settlement of disputes, the divine service, the order of widows,
deacons and deaconesses, the poor, behaviour in persecution,
and so forth. The compiler of the Constitutions finds here
material after his own heart. He is even more discursive and
more homiletical in style; he adds fresh citations of the Scriptures,
and additional explanations and moral reflexions; and
all this with so little judgment that he often leaves confusion
worse confounded (<i>e.g.</i> in ii. 57, where, upon a symbolical
description of the Church as a sheepfold, he has superimposed
the further symbolism of a ship). (<i>b</i>) Passing on to books vii.
and viii., we observe that the compiler&rsquo;s method of necessity
changes with his new material. In the former book he still
makes large additions and alterations, but there is less scope for
his prolixity than before; and in the latter, where he is no
longer dealing with generalities, but making actual definitions,
the Constitutions of necessity become more precise and statutory
in form. Throughout he adopts and adapts the language of his
sources as far as possible, &ldquo;only pruning in the most pressing
cases,&rdquo; but towards the end he cannot avoid making larger
alterations from time to time. And his alterations throughout
are not made aimlessly. Where he finds things which would
obviously clash with the customs of his own day, he unhesitatingly
modifies them. An account of the Passion, with a curiously
perverted chronology, the object of which was to justify the
length of the Passion-tide fast, is entirely revised for this reason
(v. 14); the direction to observe Easter according to the Jewish
computation is changed into the exact contrary for the same
reason (v. 17); and where his archetype lapses into speaking of a
lull in persecution he naïvely informs us that the Romans have
now given up persecuting and have adopted Christianity (vi. 26),
forgetting altogether that he is speaking in the character of the
apostles. Above all, he both magnifies the office of the Christian
ministry as a whole and alters what is said of it in detail (for
example, the deaconess loses rank not a little), to make it agree
with the circumstances of his day in general, and with his own
ideas of fitness in particular. It is here that his evidence is at
once most valuable and needs to be used with the greatest care.
To give one striking example of the value of these documents.
The <i>Canones Hippolyti</i> (vi. 43) provide that one who has been
a confessor for the faith may be received as a presbyter by
virtue of his confessorship and not by the laying on of the
bishop&rsquo;s hands; but if he be chosen a bishop, he is to be ordained.
This provision passes on into the Egyptian <i>Ecclesiastical Canons</i>
and other kindred documents, and even into the <i>Testamentum
Domini</i>. But the corresponding passage in the Apostolical
Constitutions (viii. 23) entirely reverses it: &ldquo;A confessor is not
ordained, for he is so by choice and patience, and is worthy of
great honour.... But if there be occasion, he is to be ordained
either a bishop, priest, or deacon. But if any one of the confessors
who is not ordained snatches to himself any such dignity
upon account of his confession, let the same person be deprived
and rejected; for he is not in such an office, since he has denied
the constitution of Christ, and is worse than an infidel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Who, then, is the author of the Constitutions, and what can be
inferred with regard to him? (i.) By separating off the sources
which he used from his own additions to them, it at
once becomes clear that the latter are the work of one
<span class="sidenote">Authorship, place, and date.</span>
man: the style is unmistakable, and the method of
working is the same throughout. The compiler of
books i.-vi. is also the compiler of books vii., viii. (ii.) As to
his theological position, different views have been held. Funk
suggests Apollinarianism, which is the refuge of the destitute;
and Achelis inclines in the same direction. But the affinities of
the author are quite otherwise, the most pronounced of them
being a strong subordinationist tendency, denial of a human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span>
soul to Christ, and the like, which suggest not indeed Arianism
but an inclination towards Arianism. Above all, his polemic is
directed against the dying heresies of the 3rd century; and he
writes with an absence of constraint which is not the language
of one who lives amidst violent controversies or who is conscious
of being in a minority. All this points to the position of a
&ldquo;conservative&rdquo; or semi-Arian of the East, one who belongs,
perhaps, to the circle of Lucian of Antioch and writes before the
time of Julian. It is hard to think of any other time or circumstances
in which a man could write like this, (iii.) The indications
of <i>time</i> have been held to point to a different conclusion.
On the one hand, the fact that the attempt to rebuild the temple
by Julian in 363 is not mentioned in vi. 24 points to an earlier
date; and the fact that the <span class="grk" title="kopiatai">&#954;&#959;&#960;&#953;&#8118;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> are not mentioned amongst
the church officers points in the same direction, for elsewhere they
are first mentioned in a rescript of Constantius in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 357. On
the other hand, in the cycle of feasts occur the names of several
which are probably of later date&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> Christmas and St Stephen,
which were introduced at Antioch <i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 378 and 379 respectively.
Again, Epiphanius (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 374) appears to be unacquainted with
it; he still quotes from the <i>Didascalia</i>, and elaborately explains
it away where it is contrary to the usages of his own day. But
as regards the former point, it is possible that the Apostolical
Constitutions constantly gave rise to these festivals; or, on
the other hand, that the two passages were subsequently introduced
either by the writer himself or by some other hand,
when the last book of the Constitutions was being used as a
law-book. And as regards the latter, the fact that Epiphanius
does not use the Constitutions is no proof that they had not yet
been compiled. (iv.) As to the region of composition there is no
real doubt. It was clearly the East, Syria or Palestine. Many
indications are against the latter, and Syria is strongly suggested
by the use of the Syro-Macedonian calendar. Moreover, the
writer represents the Roman Clement as the channel of communication
between the apostles and the Church. This fact
both supplies him with the name by which he is commonly
known, Pseudo-Clement, and also furnishes corroboration of his
Syrian birth; since the other spurious writings bearing the
name of Clement, the <i>Homilies</i> and <i>Recognitions</i>, are likewise of
Syrian origin. Moreover, the spurious Ignatian epistles, which
are also Syrian, depend throughout upon the Constitutions,
(v.) But this is not all. It was long ago noticed that Pseudo-Clement
bears a very close resemblance to Pseudo-Ignatius, the
interpolator of the Ignatian Epistles in the longer Greek recension.
Usher, as we have seen, identified them, and modern
criticism accepts this identification as a fact (Lagarde, Harnack,
Funk, Brightman). Lightfoot, indeed, still hesitated (<i>Ap.
Fathers</i>, II. i. 266 n.) on the ground that Pseudo-Ignatius occasionally
misunderstands the Constitutions, that the two writings give
the Roman succession differently, and that Pseudo-Clement
shows no knowledge of the Christological controversies of Nicaea.
But as regards the first of these, it is rather a case of condensed
citation than of misinterpretation; the second is explained by
the writer&rsquo;s carelessness as shown in other passages, and all are
solved if a considerable interval of time elapsed between the compilation
of the Constitutions and the spurious Ignatian epistles.</p>

<p>It seems clear then that the compiler was a Syrian, and that
he also wrote the spurious Ignatian epistles; he was likewise
probably a semi-Arian of the school of Lucian of Antioch. His
date is given by Harnack as <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 340-360, with a leaning to
340-343; by Lightfoot as the latter half of the 4th century;
by Brightman, 370-380; by Maclean, 375; and by Funk as the
beginning of the 5th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APOSTOLIC CANONS,<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> a collection of eighty-five rules for the
regulation of clerical life, appended to the eighth book of the
<i>Apostolical Constitutions</i> (<i>q.v.</i>). They are couched in brief
legislative form though on no definite plan, and deal with the
vexed questions of ecclesiastical discipline as they were raised
towards the end of the 4th century. At least half of the canons
are derived from earlier constitutions, and probably not many
of them are the actual productions of the compiler, whose aim
was to gloss over the real nature of the <i>Constitutions</i>, and secure
their incorporation with the Epistles of Clement in the New
Testament of his day. The <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i> does indeed
append the Clementine Epistles to its text of the New Testament.
The Canons may be a little later in date than the preceding
<i>Constitutions</i>, but they are evidently from the same Syrian
theological circle.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APOSTOLIC FATHERS,<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> a term used to distinguish those early
Christian writers who were believed to have been the personal
associates of the original Apostles. While the title &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo;
was given from at least the beginning of the 4th century to
church writers of former days, as being the parents of Christian
belief and thought for later times, the expression &ldquo;Apostolic
Fathers&rdquo; dates only from the latter part of the 17th century.
The idea of recognizing these &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; as a special group
exists already in the title &ldquo;Patres aevi apostolici, sive SS.
Patrum qui temporibus apostolicis floruerunt ... opera,&rdquo; under
which in 1672 J.B. Cotelier published at Paris the writings
current under the names of Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Hermas,
Ignatius and Polycarp. But the name itself is due to their next
editor, Thomas Ittig (1643-1710), in his <i>Bibliotheca Patrum
Apostolicorum</i> (1699), who, however, included under this title
only Clement, Ignatius and Polycarp. Here already appears
the doubt as to how many writers can claim the title, a doubt
which has continued ever since, and makes the contents of the
&ldquo;Apostolic Fathers&rdquo; differ so much from editor to editor.
Thus the Oratorian Andrea Gallandi (1700-1779), in re-issuing
Cotelier&rsquo;s collection in his <i>Bibliotheca Veterum Patrum</i> (1765-1781),
included the fragments of Papias and the Epistle to
Diognetus, to which recent editors have added the citations
from the &ldquo;Elders&rdquo; of Papias&rsquo;s day found in Irenaeus and,
since 1883, the <i>Didach&#275;</i>.</p>

<p>The degree of historic claim which these various writings
have to rank as the works<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> of Apostolic Fathers varies greatly
on any definition of &ldquo;apostolic.&rdquo; Originally the epithet was
meant to be taken strictly, viz. as denoting those whom history
could show to have been personally connected, or at least coeval,
with one or more apostles; and an effort was made, as by
Cotelier, to distinguish the writings rightly and wrongly assigned
to such. Thus editions tended to vary with the historical views
of editors. But the convenience of the category &ldquo;Apostolic
Fathers&rdquo; to express not only those who might possibly have
had some sort of direct contact with apostles&mdash;such as &ldquo;Barnabas,&rdquo;
Clement, Ignatius, Papias, Polycarp&mdash;but also those
who seemed specially to preserve the pure tradition of apostolic
doctrine during the sub-apostolic age, has led to its general use
in a wide and vague sense.</p>

<p>Conventionally, then, the title denotes the group of writings
which, whether in date or in internal character, are regarded as
belonging to the main stream of the Church&rsquo;s teaching during
the period between the Apostles and the Apologists (<i>i.e.</i> to
c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 140). Or to put it more exactly, the &ldquo;Apostolic Fathers&rdquo;
represent, chronologically in the main and still more from the
religious and theological standpoint, the momentous process of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span>
transition from the type of teaching in the New Testament to
that which meets us in the early Catholic Fathers, from the last
quarter of the 2nd century onwards. The Apologists no doubt
show us certain fresh factors entering into this development;
but on the whole the Apostolic Fathers by themselves go a long
way to explain the transition in question, so far as knowledge of
this <i>saeculum obscurum</i> is within our reach at all. It is
true that they do not include the whole even of the ecclesiastical
literature of the sub-apostolic age, not to mention what remains of
Gnostic and other minority types. The <i>Preaching and Apocalypse</i>
of Peter, for instance, are quite typical of the same period, and help
us to read between the lines of the Apostolic Fathers. Yet
they do not really add much to what is there already, and they
have the drawbacks of pseudonymity; they lack concrete and
personal qualities; they are general expressions of tendencies
which we cannot well locate or measure, save by means of
the Apostolic Fathers themselves or of their earliest Catholic
successors.</p>

<p>(A) In <i>external features</i> the group is far from homogeneous,
a fact which has led to their being disintegrated as a group in
certain histories of early Christian literature (<i>e.g.</i> those of
Harnack and Krüger), and classed each under its own literary
type&mdash;so sacrificing to outer form, which is quite secondary in
primitive Christian writings, the more significant fact of religious
affinity. Its original members, those still best entitled to their
name in any strict sense, are epistles, and in this respect also
most akin to Apostolic writings. Indeed Ignatius takes pleasure
in saluting his readers &ldquo;after the apostolic stamp&rdquo; (<i>ad Troll.</i>
inscr.), while yet disclaiming all desire to emulate the apostolic
manner in other respects, being fully conscious of the gulf between
himself and apostles like Peter and Paul in claim to authority
(<i>ib.</i> in. 3, <i>ad Rom.</i> iv. 3). The like holds of Polycarp,
who, in explaining that he writes to exhort the Philippians only at
their own request, adds, &ldquo;for neither am I, nor is any other like me,
able to follow the wisdom of the blessed and glorious Paul&rdquo;
(in. 2). Clement&rsquo;s epistle, indeed, conforms more to the elaborate
and treatise-like form of the Epistle to the Hebrews, on which
it draws so largely; and the same is true of &ldquo;Barnabas.&rdquo; But
one and all are influenced by study of apostolic epistles, and
witness to the impression which these produced on the men of
the next generation. Unconsciously, too, they correspond to
the apostolic type of writing in another respect, viz. their
occasional and practical character. They are evoked by pressing
needs of the hour among some definite body of Christians and
not by any literary motive.<a name="fa2e" id="fa2e" href="#ft2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a> This is a universal trait of primitive
Christian writings; so that to speak of primitive Christian
&ldquo;literature&rdquo; at all is hardly accurate, and tends to an artificial
handling of their contents. These sub-apostolic epistles are
veritable &ldquo;human documents,&rdquo; with the personal note running
through them. They are after all personal expressions of Christianity,
in which are discernible also specific types of local tradition.
To such spontaneous actuality a large part of their interest and value is due.</p>

<p>Nor is this pre-literary and vital quality really absent even
from the writing which is least entitled to a place among
&ldquo;Apostolic Fathers,&rdquo; the Epistle to Diognetus. This beautiful
picture of the Christian life as a realized ideal, and of Christians
as &ldquo;the soul&rdquo; of the world, owes its inclusion to a double error:
first, to the accidental attachment at the end of another fragment
(§ ii), which opens with the writer&rsquo;s claim to stand forth as a
teacher as being &ldquo;a disciple of apostles&rdquo;; and next, to mistaken
exegesis of this phrase as implying personal relations with
apostles, rather than knowledge of their teaching, written or oral.
Whether in form addressed to Diognetus, the tutor of Marcus
Aurelius, as a typical cultured observer of Christianity, or to
some other eminent person of the same name in the locality of its
origin, or, as seems more likely, to cultured Greeks generally,
personified under the significant name &ldquo;Diognetus&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Heaven-born,&rdquo; of. Acts xvii. 28 along with § iii. 4)&mdash;the
epistle is in any case an &ldquo;open letter&rdquo; of an essentially literary
type. Further, its opening seems modelled on the lines of the
preface to Luke&rsquo;s Gospel, to which, along with Acts, it may owe
something of its very conception as a reasoned appeal to the
lover of truth. But while literary in form and conception, its
appeal is in spirit so personal a testimony to what the Gospel
has done for the writer and his fellow Christians, that it is akin
to the piety of the Apostolic Fathers as a group. It is true
that it has marked affinities, <i>e.g.</i> in its natural theology,
with the earliest Apologists, Aristides and Justin, even as it is
itself in substance an apology addressed not to the State, but to
thoughtful public opinion. But this only means that we cannot draw
a hard and fast line between groups of early Christian writings at
a time when practical religious interests overshadowed all others.</p>

<p>If thus related to the Apologists of the middle of the 2nd
century, the Epistle to Diognetus has also points of contact
with one of the most practical and least literary writings found
among our Apostolic Fathers, viz. the homily originally known
as the Second Epistle of Clement (for this ascription, as for other
details, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Clementine Literature</a></span>). The recovery of its
concluding sections in the same MS. which brought the <i>Didach&#275;</i>
to light, proves beyond question that we have here the earliest
extant sermon preached before a Christian congregation, about
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 120-140 (so J.B. Lightfoot). Its opening section, recalling
to its hearers the passing of the mists of idolatry before the
revelation in Jesus Christ, is markedly similar in tone and tenor to
passages in the Epistle to Diognetus. Far closer, however, are
the affinities between the homily and the <i>Shepherd of Hermas</i>,
&ldquo;the first Christian allegory,&rdquo; which as a literary whole dates
from about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 140, but probably represents a more or less
prolonged prophetic activity on the part of its author, the brother
of Pius, the Roman bishop of his day (<i>c.</i> 139-154). In both the
primary theme is repentance, as called for by serious sins, after
baptism has placed the Christian on his new and higher level of
responsibility. Thus both are hortatory writings, the one
argumentative in form, the other prophetic, after the manner
of later Old Testament prophets whose messages came in visions
and similitudes. This prophetic and apocalyptic note, which
characterizes Hermas among the Apostolic Fathers (though there are
traces of it also in the <i>Didach&#275;</i> and in Ignatius, <i>ad Eph.</i> xx.),
is a genuinely primitive trait and goes far to explain the vogue which the
<i>Shepherd</i> enjoyed in the generations immediately succeeding,
as also the influence of its disciplinary policy, which is its
prophetic &ldquo;burden&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hermas, Shepherd of</a></span>).</p>

<p>We come finally to the anonymous <i>Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</i>
and Papias&rsquo;s <i>Exposition of Oracles of the Lord</i>, so far as this
is known to us. The former, besides embodying catechetical instruction
in Christian conduct (the &ldquo;Two Ways&rdquo;), which goes back in substance to
the early apostolic age and is embodied also in &ldquo;Barnabas,&rdquo; depicts in
outline the fundamental usages of
church life as practised in some conservative region (probably
within Syria) about the last quarter of the 1st century and
perhaps even later. The whole is put forth as substantially the
apostolic teaching (<i>Didach&#275;</i>) on the subjects in question. This
is probably a <i>bona fide</i> claim. It expresses the feeling common
to the Apostolic Fathers and general in the sub-apostolic age, at any
rate in regions where apostles had once laboured, that local tradition,
as held by the recognized church leaders, did
but continue apostolic doctrine and practice. Into later developments
of this feeling an increasing element of illusion entered,
and all other written embodiments of it known to us take the
form of literary fictions, more or less bold. It is in contrast to
these that the <i>Didach&#275;</i> is justly felt to be genuinely primitive
and of a piece with the Apostolic Fathers. Thus while its form
would by analogy tend <i>per se</i> to awaken suspicion, its contents
remove this feeling; and we may even infer from this surviving
early formulation of local ecclesiastical tradition, that others of
somewhat similar character came into being in the sub-apostolic
age, but failed to survive save as embodied in later local teaching,
oral or written, very much as if the <i>Didach&#275;</i> had perished
and its literary offspring alone remained (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Didach&#275;</a></span>).</p>

<p>As regards Papias&rsquo;s <i>Exposition</i>, which Lightfoot describes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>
as &ldquo;among the earliest forerunners of commentaries, partly
explanatory, partly illustrative, on portions of the New Testament,&rdquo;
we need here only remark that, whatever its exact form
may have been&mdash;as to which the extant fragments still leave
room for doubt&mdash;it was in conception expository of the historic
meaning of Christ&rsquo;s more ambiguous Sayings, viewed in the light
of definitely ascertained apostolic traditions bearing on the
subject. The like is true also of the fragments of the Elders
preserved in Irenaeus (so far as these do not really come from
Papias). Both bodies of exposition represent the traditional
principle at work in the sub-apostolic age, making for the preservation
in relative purity, over against merely subjective interpretations&mdash;those
of the Gnostics in particular&mdash;of the historic
or original sense of Christ&rsquo;s teaching, just as Ignatius stood for
the historicity of the facts of His earthly career in their plain,
natural sense.</p>

<p>(B) Here the question of external form passes readily over
into that of the <i>internal character and spirit</i>. Indeed much has
already been said or suggested bearing on these. The relation
of these writers to the apostolic teaching generally has become
pretty evident. It is one of absolute loyalty and deference,
as to the teaching of inspiration. They are conscious, as are we
in reading them, that they are not moving on the same level of
insight as the Apostles; they are sub-apostolic in that sense
also. Hence there appear constant traces of study of the
Apostolic writings, so far as these were accessible in the locality
of each writer at his date of writing (for the details of this subject,
and its bearing on the history of the Canonical Scriptures of the
New Testament, see <i>The New Testament in the Apostolic Fathers</i>,
Oxford, 1905). As Lightfoot points out (<i>Apostolic Fathers</i>,
pt. i. vol. i. p. 7), however, personality, with its variety of
temperament and emphasis, largely colours the Apostolic
Fathers, especially the primary group. Clement has all the
Roman feeling for duly constituted order and discipline;
Ignatius has the Syrian or semi-oriental passion of devotion,
showing itself at once in his mystic love for his Lord and his
over-strained yearning to become His very &ldquo;disciple&rdquo; by drinking
the like cup of martyrdom; Polycarp is, above all things,
steady in his allegiance to what had first won his conscience
and heart, and his &ldquo;passive and receptive character&rdquo; comes
out in the contents of his epistle. Of the rest, whose personalities
are less known to us, Papias shares Polycarp&rsquo;s qualities and
their limitations, the anonymous homilist and Hermas are
marked by intense moral earnestness, while the writer to Diognetus
joins to this a profound religious insight. These personal
traits determine by selective affinity, working under conditions
given by the special local type of tradition and piety, the elements
in the Apostolic writings which each was able to assimilate and
express&mdash;though we must allow also for variety in the occasions
of writing. Thus one New Testament type is echoed in one and
another in another; or it may be several in turn. The latter
is the case in Clement, Ignatius and Polycarp; perhaps also in
&ldquo;Barnabas.&rdquo; In Hermas there is special affinity to the language
and thought of the epistle of James, and in the homilist to those
of Paul. Yet their very use of the same terms or ideas makes
us the more aware of &ldquo;a marked contrast to the depth and clearness
of conception with which the several Apostolic writers place
before us different aspects of the Gospel&rdquo; (Lightfoot). While
Apostolic phrases are used, the sense behind them is often
different and less evangelic. They have not caught the Apostolic
meaning, because they have not penetrated to the full religious
experience which gave to the words, often words with long and
varied history both in the Septuagint and in ordinary Greek
usage, their specific meaning to each apostle and especially to
Paul. This phenomenon was noted particularly by E. Reuss, in
his <i>Histoire de la théologie chrétienne an siècle apostolique</i> (3rd
ed., 1864). Take for instance Clement. Lightfoot, indeed, dwells
on the all-round &ldquo;comprehensiveness&rdquo; with which Clement,
as the mouthpiece of the early Roman Church, utters in succession
phrases or ideas borrowed impartially from Peter and Paul
and James and the Epistle to Hebrews. He admits, however,
that such mere co-ordination of the language of Paul and James,
for instance, as appears in his twice bracketing &ldquo;faith and
hospitality&rdquo; as grounds of acceptance with God (the cases are
those of Abraham and Rahab, in chs. x. and xii.), is &ldquo;from a
strictly dogmatic point of view&rdquo; his weakness. But the weakness
is more than a dogmatic one; it is one of religious experience, as
the source of spiritual insight. It is not merely that &ldquo;there is no
<i>dogmatic system</i> in Clement&rdquo; or in any other of the Apostolic
Fathers; that may favour, not hinder, religious insight. There
is a want of depth in Christian experience, in the power of
realizing relative spiritual values in the light of the master principle
involved in the distinctively Christian consciousness, such
as could raise Clement above a verbal eclecticism, rather than
comprehensiveness, in the use of Apostolic language. As R.W.
Dale remarks, in a note on Reuss&rsquo;s too severe words (Eng. trans.
ii. 295): &ldquo;The vital force of the Apostolic convictions gave to
Apostolic thought a certain organic and consistent form.&rdquo; It is
lack of this organic quality in the thought, not only of Clement
but also of the Apostolic Fathers generally&mdash;with the possible
exception of Ignatius, who seems to share the Apostolic experience
more fully than any other, to which Reuss rightly directs
attention. In virtue of this defect, due largely to the failure to
enter into the Apostolic experience of mystic union with Christ,
he can rightly speak of &ldquo;an immense retrogression&rdquo; in theology
visible &ldquo;at the end of the century, and in circles where it might
have been least expected&rdquo; (ii. p. 294, cf. 541).</p>

<p>In fact the perspective of the Gospel was seriously changed
and its most distinctive features obscured. This was specially
the case with the experimental doctrines of grace. Here the
central glory of the Cross as &ldquo;the power of God unto salvation&rdquo;
suffered some eclipse, although the passion of Christ was felt to
be a transcendent act of Divine Grace in one way or another.
But even more serious was the loss of an adequate sense of
the contrast between &ldquo;grace&rdquo; and &ldquo;works&rdquo; as conditions of
salvation. There was little or no sense of the danger of the
<i>legal principle</i>, as related to human egoism and the instinct to
seek salvation as a reward for merit. The passages in which
these things are laid bare by Paul&rsquo;s remorseless analysis of his
own experience &ldquo;under Law&rdquo; seem to have made practically
no impression on the Apostolic Fathers as a whole. Gentile
Christians had not felt the fang of the Law as the ex-Pharisee
had occasion to feel it. Even if first trained in the Hellenistic
synagogues of the Dispersion, as was often the case, they apprehended
the Law on its more helpful and less exacting side,
and had not been brought &ldquo;by the Law to die unto the Law,&rdquo;
that they might &ldquo;live unto God.&rdquo; The result was too great a
continuity between their religious conceptions before and after
embracing the Gospel. Thus the latter seemed to them simply
to bring forgiveness of past sins for Christ&rsquo;s sake, and then an
enhanced moral responsibility to the New Law revealed in
Him. Hence a new sort of legalism, known to recent writers as
Moralism, underlies much of the piety of the Apostolic Fathers,
though Ignatius is quite free from it, while Polycarp and
&ldquo;Barnabas&rdquo; are less under its influence than are the <i>Didach&#275;</i>,
Clement, the Homilist and Hermas. It conceives salvation as
a &ldquo;wages&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="osthos">&#956;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#972;&#962;</span>) to be earned or forfeited; and regards
certain good works, such as prayer, fasting, alms&mdash;especially
the last&mdash;as efficacious to cancel sins. The reality of this
tendency, particularly at Rome, betrays itself in Hermas, who
teaches the supererogatory merit of alms gained by the self-denial
of fasting (<i>Sim</i>. v. 3. 3 ff.). Marcion&rsquo;s reaction, too,
against the Judaic temper in the Church as a whole, in the
interests of an extravagant Paulinism, while it suggests that
Paul&rsquo;s doctrines of grace generally were inadequately realized in
the sub-apostolic age, points also to the prevalence of such
moralism in particular.</p>

<p>(C) In attempting a final estimate of the value of the Apostolic
Fathers for the historian to-day, we may sum up under these
heads: ecclesiastical, theological, religious. (<i>a</i>) As a mine of
materials for reconstructing the history of Church institutions,
they are invaluable, and that largely in virtue of their spontaneous
and &ldquo;esoteric&rdquo; character, with no view to the public
generally or to posterity. (<i>b</i>) Theologically, as a stage in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
history of Christian doctrine, their value is as great negatively
as positively. Impressive as is their witness to the persistence
of the Apostolic teaching in its essential features, amidst all
personal and local variations, perhaps the most striking thing
about these writings is the degree in which they fail to appreciate
certain elements of the Apostolic teaching as embodied in the
New Testament, and those its higher and more distinctively
Christian elements.<a name="fa3e" id="fa3e" href="#ft3e"><span class="sp">3</span></a> This negative aspect has a twofold bearing.
Firstly, it suggests the supernormal level to which the Apostolic
consciousness was raised at a bound by the direct influence of
the Founder of Christianity, and justifies the marking-off of the
Apostolic writings as a Canon, or body of Christian classics of
unique religious authority. To this principle Marcion&rsquo;s Pauline
Canon is a witness, though in too one-sided a spirit. Secondly,
it means that the actual development of ecclesiastical doctrine
began, not from the Apostolic consciousness itself, but from a
far lower level, that of the inadequate consciousness of the sub-apostolic
Church, even when face to face with their written words.
This theological &ldquo;retrogression&rdquo; is of much significance for the
history of dogma, (<i>c</i>) On the other hand, there is great religious
and moral continuity, beneath even theological discontinuity, in
the life working below all conscious apprehension of the deeper
ideas involved (E. von Dobschutz, <i>Christian Life in the Primitive
Church</i>, 1905). There is continuity in character; the Apostolic
Fathers strike us as truly good men, with a goodness raised to a
new type and power. This is what the Gospel of Christ aims
chiefly at producing as its proper fruit; and the Apostolic
Fathers would have desired no better record than that they
were themselves genuine &ldquo;epistles of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Literature</span>.&mdash;This is too large to indicate even in outline, but
is given fully in the chief modern editions, viz. of Gebhardt, Harnack
and Zahn jointly (1875-1877), J.B. Lightfoot (1885-1890) and
F.X. Funk (1901); also in O. Bardenhewer, <i>Gesch. der altkirchlichen

The fullest discussion in English of the teaching of Barnabas,
Clement, Ignatius and Polycarp is by J. Donaldson, <i>The Apostolical
Fathers</i> (1874), which, however, suffers from the imperfect state of
the texts when he wrote. The most useful edition for ready reference,
containing critical texts (up to date) and good translations,
is Lightfoot&rsquo;s one-volume edition, <i>The Apostolic Fathers</i> (London,

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APOSTOLICI<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span>, <span class="sc">Apostolic Brethren</span>, or <span class="sc">Apostles</span>, the
names given to various Christian heretics, whose common
doctrinal feature was an ascetic rigidity of morals, which made
them reject property and marriage. The earliest Apostolici
appeared in Phrygia, Cilicia, Pisidia and Pamphylia towards
the end of the 2nd century or the beginning of the 3rd. According
to the information given by Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> 61) about
the doctrines of these heretics, it is evident that they were
connected with the Encratites and the Tatianians. They condemned
individual property, hence the name sometimes given to
them of <i>Apotactites</i> or <i>Renuntiatores</i>. They preserved an absolute
chastity and abstained from wine and meat. They refused to
admit into their sect those Christians whom the fear of martyrdom
had once restored to paganism. As late as the 4th century
St Basil (<i>Can</i>. 1 and 47) knew some Apostolici. After that
period they disappeared, either becoming completely extinct,
or being confounded with other sects (see St Augustine, <i>Haer.</i>
40; John of Damascus, <i>Haer.</i> 61).</p>

<p>Failing a more exact designation, the name of Apostolici has
been given to certain groups of Latin heretics of the 12th century.
It is the second of the two sects of Cologne (the first being composed
very probably of Cathari) that is referred to in the letter
addressed in 1146 by Everwin, provost of Steinfeld, to St Bernard
(Mabillon, <i>Vet. Anal.</i> iii. 452). They condemned marriage (save,
perhaps, first marriages), the eating of meat, baptism of children,
veneration of saints, fasting, prayers for the dead and belief in
purgatory, denied transubstantiation, declared the Catholic
priesthood worthless, and considered the whole church of their
time corrupted by the &ldquo;negotia saecularia&rdquo; which absorbed all
its zeal (of. St Bernard, <i>Serm.</i> 65 and 66 <i>in Cantic.</i>). They do
not seem to have been known as Apostles or Apostolici: St
Bernard, in fact, asks his hearers: &ldquo;Quo nomine istos titulove
censebis?&rdquo; (<i>Serm. 66 in Cantic.</i>). Under this designation, too,
are included the heretics of Perigueux in France, alluded to in
the letter of a certain monk Heribert (Mabillon, <i>Vet. Anal.</i> iii.
467). Heribert says merely: &ldquo;Se dicunt apostolicam vitam
ducere.&rdquo; It is possible that they were Henricians (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Henry
of Lausanne</a></span>). During his mission in the south-east of France
in 1146-1147 St Bernard still met disciples of Henry of Lausanne
in the environs of Périgueux. The heretics of whom Heribert
speaks condemned riches, denied the value of the sacraments
and of good works, ate no meat, drank no wine and rejected
the veneration of images. Their leader, named Pons, gathered
round him nobles, priests, monks and nuns.</p>

<p>In the second half of the 13th century appeared in Italy the
<i>Order of the Apostles</i> or <i>Apostle Brethren</i> (see especially the <i>Chron.</i>
of Fra Salimbene). This was a product of the mystic fermentation
which proceeded from exalted Franciscanism and from
Joachimism (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fraticelli</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Joachim</a></span>). It presents great
analogies with groups of the same character, <i>e.g.</i> Sachets,
Bizocchi, Flagellants, &amp;c. The order of the Apostles was founded
about 1260 by a young workman from the environs of Parma,
Gerard Segarelli, who had sought admission unsuccessfully to
the Franciscan order. To make his life conform to that of
Christ, his contemporaries say that he had himself circumcised,
wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a cradle, and that he
then, clad in a white robe and bare-footed, walked through
the streets of Parma crying &ldquo;Penitenz agite!&rdquo; (&ldquo;Poenitentiam
agite!&rdquo;). He was soon followed by a throng of men and women,
peasants and mechanics. All had to live in absolute poverty,
chastity and idleness. They begged, and preached penitence.
Opizo, bishop of Parma, protected them until they caused
trouble in his diocese. Their diffusion into several countries
of Christendom disturbed Pope Honorius IV., who in 1286
ordered them to adhere to an already recognized rule. On their
refusal, the pope condemned them to banishment and Opizo
imprisoned Segarelli. The councils of Würzburg (1287) and
Chichester (1289) took measures against the Apostles of Germany
and England. But in 1291 the sect reappeared, sensibly increased,
and Pope Nicholas IV. published anew the bull of
Honorius IV. From that day the Apostles, regarded as rebels,
were persecuted pitilessly. Four were burned in 1294, and
Segarelli, as a relapsed heretic, went to the stake at Parma in
1300.</p>

<p>They had had close relations with the dissident Franciscans,
but the Spirituals often disavowed them, especially when the
sect, which in Segarelli&rsquo;s time had had no very precise doctrinal
character, became with Dolcino frankly heterodox. Dolcino of
Novara was brought up at Vercelli, and had been an Apostle
since 1291. Thrice he fell into the hands of the Inquisition, and
thrice recanted. But immediately after Segarelli&rsquo;s death he
wrote an epistle, soon followed by a second, in which he declared
that the third Joachimite age began with Segarelli and that
Frederick of Sicily was the expected conqueror (<i>Hist. Dulcini</i>
and <i>Addit. ad Hist. Dulcini</i> in Muratori, <i>Scriptores</i>, vol. ix.).
He gave himself out as an angel sent from God to elucidate the
prophecies. Soon he founded an <i>Apostolic congregation</i> at whose
head he placed himself. Under him were his four lieutenants,
his &ldquo;mystic sister,&rdquo; Margherita di Franck, and 4000 disciples.
He taught almost the same principles of devotion as Segarelli,
but the Messianic character which he attributed to himself,
the announcement of a communistic millennial kingdom, and,
besides, an aggressive anti-sacerdotalism, gave to Dolcino&rsquo;s sect
a clearly marked character, analogous only to the theocratic
community of the Anabaptists of Münster in the 16th century.
On the 5th of June 1305 Pope Clement V., recognizing the
impotence of the ordinary methods of repression, issued bulls
for preaching a crusade against the Dolcinists. But four
crusades, directed by the bishop of Vercelli, were required to
reduce the little army of the heresiarch, entrenched in the
mountains in the neighbourhood of Vercelli. Not till the 23rd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
of March 1307 were the sectaries definitively overcome. The
Catholic crusaders seized Dolcino in his entrenchments on
Mount Rubello, and the pope at once announced the happy
event to King Philip the Fair. At Vercelli Dolcino suffered a
horrible punishment. He was torn in pieces with red-hot
pincers&mdash;the torture lasting an entire day&mdash;while Margherita
was burned at a slow fire. Dante mentions Dolcino&rsquo;s name
(<i>Inferno</i>, c. xxviii.), and his memory is not yet completely effaced
in the province of Novara. The Apostles continued their
propaganda in Italy, Languedoc, Spain and Germany. In turn
they were condemned by the councils of Cologne (1306), Treves
(1310) and Spoleto (1311). The inquisitor of Languedoc,
Bernard Gui, persecuted them unremittingly (see Gui&rsquo;s <i>Practica
Inquisitionis</i>). From 1316 to 1323 the condemnations of
Apostles increased at Avignon and Toulouse. They disappeared,
however, at a comparatively late date from those regions (council
of Lavaur, 1368; council of Narbonne, 1374). In Germany
two Apostles were burned at Lübeck and Wismar at the beginning
of the 15th century (1402-1403) by the inquisitor Eylard.</p>

<p>Several controversialists, including Gotti, Krohn and Stockmann,
have mentioned among the innumerable sects that have
sprung from Anabaptism a group of individuals whose open-air
preaching and rigorous practice of poverty gained them the name
of Apostolici. These must be carefully distinguished from the
<i>Apostoolians</i>, Mennonites of Frisia, who followed the teachings of
the pastor Samuel Apostool (1638-beginning of 18th century).
In the Mennonite church they represent the rigid, conservative
party, as opposed to the Galenists, who inclined towards the
Arminian latitudinarianism and admitted into their community
all those who led a virtuous life, whatever their doctrinal
tendencies.</p>

where he earned a scanty living by teaching and by copying

the repository where his medicines were kept, now obsolete in
its original sense. An apothecary was one who prepared, sold
and prescribed drugs, but the preparing and selling of drugs
prescribed by others has now passed into the hands of duly
qualified and authorized persons termed &ldquo;chemists and druggists,&rdquo;
while the apothecary, by modern legislation, has become
a general medical practitioner, and the word itself, when used at
all, is applied, more particularly in the United States and in
Scotland, to those who in England are called &ldquo;pharmaceutical
chemists.&rdquo; The Apothecaries&rsquo; Society of London is one of the
corporations of that city, and both by royal charters and acts of
parliament exercises the power of granting licences to practise
medicine. The members of this society do not possess and
never have possessed any exclusive power to deal in or sell
drugs; and until 1868 any person whatever might open what is
called a chemist&rsquo;s shop, and deal in drugs and poisons. In that
year, however, the Pharmacy Act was passed, which prohibits
any person from engaging in this business without being
registered.</p>

<p>From early records we learn that the different branches of
the medical profession were not regularly distinguished till the
reign of Henry VIII., when separate duties were assigned to
them, and peculiar privileges were granted to each. In 1518
the physicians of London were incorporated, and the barber-surgeons
in 1540. But, independently of the physicians and the
surgeons, there were a great number of irregular practitioners,
who were more or less molested by their legitimate rivals, and it
became necessary to pass an act in 1543 for their protection and
toleration. As many of these practitioners kept shops for the
sale of medicines, the term &ldquo;apothecary&rdquo; was used to designate
their calling.</p>

<p>In April 1606 James I. incorporated the apothecaries as one
of the city companies, uniting them with the grocers. On their
charter being renewed in 1617 they were formed into a separate
corporation, under the title of the &ldquo;Apothecaries of the City of
London.&rdquo; These apothecaries appear to have prescribed
medicines in addition to dispensing them, and to have claimed
an ancient right of acting in this double capacity; and it may
be mentioned that Henry VIII., after the grant of the charter
to the College of Physicians, appointed an apothecary to the
Princess Mary, who was delicate and unhealthy, at a salary of
40 marks a year, &ldquo;<i>pro meliore cura, et consideratione sanitatis
suae</i>.&rdquo; During the 17th century, however, there arose a warm
contest between the physicians and the apothecaries,&mdash;the
former accusing the latter of usurping their province, and the
latter continuing and justifying the usurpation until the dispute
was finally set at rest by a judgment of the House of Lords in
1703 (<i>Rose v. College of Physicians</i>, 5 Bro. P. C. 553), when it was
decided that the duty of the apothecary consisted not only in
compounding and dispensing, but also in directing and ordering
the remedies employed in the treatment of disease. In 1722
an act was obtained empowering the Apothecaries&rsquo; Company to
visit the shops of all apothecaries practising in London, and to
destroy such drugs as they found unfit for use. In 1748 great
additional powers were given to the company by an act authorizing
them to appoint a board of ten examiners, without whose
licence no person should be allowed to dispense medicines in
London, or within a circuit of 7 m. round it. In 1815, however,
an act of parliament was passed which gave the Apothecaries&rsquo;
Society a new position, empowering a board, consisting of twelve
of their members, to examine and license all apothecaries
throughout England and Wales. It also enacted that, from the
1st of August of that year, no persons except those who were so
licensed should have the right to act as apothecaries, and it
gave the society the power of prosecuting those who practised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
without such licence. But the act expressly exempted from
prosecution all persons who were then in actual practice, and it
distinctly excluded from its operation all persons pursuing the
calling of chemists and druggists. It was also provided that
the act should in no way interfere with the rights or privileges
of the English universities, or of the English College of Surgeons
or the College of Physicians; and indeed a clause imposed
severe penalties on any apothecaries who should refuse to compound
and dispense medicines on the order of a physician,
legally qualified to act as such. It is therefore clear that the
act contemplated the creation of a class of practitioners who,
while having the right to practise medicine, should assist and
co-operate with the physicians and surgeons.</p>

<p>Before this act came into operation the education of the
medical practitioners of England and Wales was entirely optional
on their own part, and although many of them possessed degrees
or licences from the universities or colleges, the greater number
possessed no such qualification, and many of them were wholly
illiterate and uneducated. The court of examiners of the
Apothecaries&rsquo; Society, being empowered to enforce the acquisition
of a sufficient medical education upon its future licentiates,
specified from time to time the courses of lectures or terms of
hospital practice to be attended by medical students before their
examination, and in the progress of years regular schools of
medicine were organized throughout England.</p>

<p>As it was found that, notwithstanding the stringent regulations
as to medical acquirements, the candidates were in many
instances deficient in preliminary education, the court of
examiners instituted, about the year 1850, a preliminary
examination in arts as a necessary and indispensable prerequisite
to the medical curriculum, and this provision has been so expanded
that, at the present day, all medical students in the
United Kingdom are compelled to pass a preliminary examination
in arts, unless they hold a university degree. An act of parliament,
passed in 1858, and known as the Medical Act, made
very little alteration in the powers exercised by the Apothecaries&rsquo;
Society, and indeed it confirmed and in some degree amplified
them, for whereas by the act of 1815, the licentiates of the society
were authorized to practise as such only in England and Wales,
the new measure gave them the same right in Scotland and
Ireland. The Medical Act 1886 extended the qualifications
necessary for registration under the medical acts, by making it
necessary to pass a qualifying examination in medicine, surgery
and midwifery. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Medical Education</a></span>.)</p>

<p>An act, passed in 1874, related exclusively to the Apothecaries&rsquo;
Society, and is termed the Apothecaries&rsquo; Act Amendment Act.
By this measure some provisions of the act of 1815, which had
become obsolete or unsuitable, were repealed, and powers were
given to the society to unite or co-operate with other medical
licensing bodies in granting licences to practise. The act of
1815 had made it compulsory on all candidates for a licence to
have served an apprenticeship of five years to an apothecary,
and although by the interpretation of the court of examiners
of the society this term really included the whole period of
medical study, yet the regulation was felt as a grievance by many
members of the medical profession. It was accordingly repealed,
and no apprenticeship is now necessary. The restriction of the
choice of examiners to the members of the society was also
repealed, and the society was given the power (which it did not
before possess) to strike off from the list of its licentiates the
names of disreputable persons. The act of 1874 also specified
that the society was not deprived of any right or obligation they
may have to admit women to examination, and to enter their
names on the list of licentiates if they acquit themselves
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The Apothecaries&rsquo; Society is governed by a master, two
wardens and twenty-two assistants. The members are divided
into Three grades, yeomanry or freemen, the livery, and the court.
Women are not, however, admitted to the freedom. The hall
of the society, situated in Water Lane, London, and covering
about three-quarters of an acre, was acquired in 1633. It was
destroyed by the great fire, but was rebuilt about ten years later
and enlarged in 1786. This is the only property possessed by
the society. In 1673, the society established a botanic and physic
garden at Chelsea, and in 1722 Sir Hans Sloane, who had become
the ground owner, gave it to the society on the condition of
presenting annually to the Royal Society fifty dried specimens
of plants till the number should reach 2000. This condition was
fulfilled in 1774. Owing to the heavy cost of maintenance and
other reasons, the &ldquo;physic garden&rdquo; was handed over in 1902,
with the consent of the Charity Commissioners, to a committee
of management, to be maintained in the interests of botanical
study and research.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APOTHEOSIS<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="apotheoûn">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span>, to make a god, to deify), literally
deification. The term properly implies a clear polytheistic
conception of gods in contrast with men, while it recognizes that
some men cross the dividing line. It is characteristic of polytheism
to blur that line in several ways. Thus the ancient Greek
religion was especially disposed to belief in heroes and demigods.
Founders of cities, and even of colonies, received worship; the
former are, generally speaking, mythical personages and, in
strictness, heroes. But the worship after death of historical
persons, such as Lycurgus, or worship of the living as true
deities, <i>e.g.</i> Lysander and Philip II. of Macedon, occurred
sporadically even before Alexander&rsquo;s conquests brought Greek
life into contact with oriental traditions. It was inevitable, too,
that ancient monarchies should enlist polytheistic conceptions of
divine or half-divine men in support of the dynasties; &ldquo;<i>Seu deos
regesve canit deorum Sanguinem</i>,&rdquo; Horace (<i>Odes</i>, iv. 2, II. 12, 13)
writes of Pindar; though the reference is to myths, yet the
phrase is significant. In the East all such traits are exaggerated,
a result perhaps rather of the statecraft than of the religions of
Egypt and Persia. Whatever part vanity or the flattery of
courtiers may have played with others, or with Alexander, it is
significant that the dynasties of Alexander&rsquo;s various successors
all claim divine honours of some sort (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ptolemies</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Seleucid
Dynasty</a></span>, &amp;c.). Theocritus (<i>Idyll</i> 17) hails Ptolemy Philadelphus
as a demigod, and speaks of his father as seated among the
gods along with Alexander. Ancestor worship, or reverence for
the dead, was a third factor. It may work even in Cicero&rsquo;s
determination that his daughter should enjoy &ldquo;<span class="grk" title="apothéôsis">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#941;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>&rdquo;&mdash;
as he writes to Atticus&mdash;or receive the &ldquo;honour&rdquo; of <i>consecratia</i>
(fragment of his <i>De Consolatione</i>). Lastly, we need not speak of
mere sycophancy. Yet it was common; Verres was worshipped
before he was impeached!</p>

<p>The Romans had, up to the end of the Republic, accepted
only one official apotheosis; the god Quirinus, whatever his
original meaning, having been identified with Romulus. But
the emperor Augustus carried on the tradition of ancient
statecraft by having Julius Caesar recognized as a god (<i>divus
Julius</i>), the first of a new class of deities proper (<i>divi</i>). The
tradition was steadily followed and was extended to some ladies
of the imperial family and even to imperial favourites. Worship
of an emperor during his lifetime, except as the worship of his
<i>genius</i>, was, save in the cases of Caligula and Domitian, confined
to the provinces. Apotheosis after his death, being in the hands
of the senate, did not at once cease, even when Christianity was
officially adopted. The Latin term is <i>consecratio</i>, which of course
has a variety of senses, including simple burial. (Inscription in
G. Boissier, <i>La Religion romaine</i>; Renier, <i>Inscriptions d&rsquo;Algiers</i>,
2510.) The Greek term Apotheosis, probably a coinage of the
Hellenistic epoch, becomes more nearly technical for the deification
of dead emperors. But it is still used simply for the erection
of tombs (clearly so in some Greek inscriptions, <i>Corpus Inscript.
Graec.</i> 2831, 2832, quoted in Pauly-Wissowa, <i>s.v. Apotheosis</i>).
Possibly there is a trace of ancestor worship even here; but the
two usages have diverged. The squib of the philosopher Seneca
on the memory of Claudius (d. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 54), <i>Apocolocyntosis</i> (&ldquo;pumpkinification&rdquo;),
is evidence that, as early as Seneca&rsquo;s lifetime,
apotheosis was in use for the recognition of a departed emperor
as a god. It also indicates how much contempt might be
associated with this pretended worship. The people, says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
Suetonius (<i>Jul. Caes.</i> c. 88), fully believed in the divinity of
Julius Caesar, hinting at the same time that this was by no
means the case with the majority of the apotheoses subsequently
decreed by the senate. Yet we learn from Capitolinus that
Marcus Aurelius was still worshipped as a household divinity in
the time of Diocletian, and was believed to impart revelations in
dreams (Vit. M. Ant. c. 18). Antinous, the favourite of Hadrian,
was adored in Egypt a century after his death (Origen, <i>Contra
Celsum</i>, iii. 36), though, according to Boissier, his worship never
had official sanction. The ceremonies attendant on an imperial
apotheosis are very fully described by Herodianus (bk. iv. c. 2)
on occasion of the obsequies of Severus, which he appears to
have witnessed. The most significant was the liberation, at the
moment of kindling the funeral pyre, of an eagle which was
supposed to bear the emperor&rsquo;s soul to heaven. Sharp-sighted
persons had actually beheld the ascension of Augustus (Suet.
<i>August</i>, c. 100), and of Drusilla, sister of Caligula. Representations
of apotheoses occur on several works of art; the most important
are the apotheosis of Homer on a relief in the Townley collection
of the British Museum, that of Titus on the arch of Titus,
and that of Augustus on a magnificent cameo in the Louvre.</p>

<p>In China at the present day many Taoist gods are (or are
given out as) men deified for service to the state. This again
may be statecraft. In India, the (still unexplained) rise of the
doctrine of transmigration hindered belief. Apotheosis can
mean nothing to those who hold that a man may be reborn as a
god, but still needs redemption, and that men on earth may
win redemption, if they are brave enough. Curiously, Buddhism
itself is ruled by the ghost or shadowy remainder of belief in
transmigration&mdash;Karma.</p>

<p>Apotheosis may also be used in wider senses. (<i>a</i>) Some (<i>e.g.</i>
Herbert Spencer) hold that most gods are deified men, and most
myths historical traditions which have been grotesquely distorted.
This theory is known as Euhemerism (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Euhemerus</a></span>). It is
needless to say that the attitude of those holding the Euhemerist
theory is at the farthest pole from belief in apotheosis. According
to the latter, some men may become gods. According to
the former, all gods are but men; or, some men have been
erroneously supposed to become gods. The Euhemerist theory
mainly appeals to ancestor worship&mdash;a fact of undoubted
importance in the history of religion, especially in China and
in ancient Rome. In India, too, a dead person treated with
funeral honours becomes a guardian spirit&mdash;if neglected, a
tormenting demon. But whether the great gods of polytheism
were really transfigured ancestors is very doubtful. (<i>b</i>) Again,
there is a tendency to offer something like worship to the
founders of religions. Thus more than human honour is
paid to Zoroaster and Buddha and even to the founders of
systems not strictly religious, <i>e.g.</i> to Confucius and Auguste
Comte. It is noticeable that this kind of worship is not accorded
in rigidly monotheistic systems, <i>e.g.</i> to Moses and Mahomet.
Nor is it accurate to speak of apotheosis in cases where the
founder is in his lifetime regarded as the incarnation of a god
(cf. Ali among Shi&rsquo;ite Mahommedans; the B&#259;b in Babism; the
Druse Hakim). Most Christians on this ground repudiate the
application of the term to the worship of Jesus Christ. Curiously,
<i>Apotheosis</i> is used by the Latin Christian poet, Prudentius
(<i>c.</i> 400), as the title of a poem defending orthodox views on the
person of Christ and other points of doctrine&mdash;the affectation
of a decadent age. (<i>c</i>) The worship paid to Saints, in those
Christian churches which admit it, is formally distinguished as
<i>dulia</i> (<span class="grk" title="douleia">&#948;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#945;</span>) from true worship or <i>latria</i> (<span class="grk" title="latreia">&#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#945;</span>). Even the
Virgin Mary, though she is styled Mother of God and Queen of
Heaven, receives only <i>dulia</i> or at most <i>hyperdulia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS,<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> the general name given to a
vast system of elevations in North America, partly in Canada,
but mostly in the United States, extending as a zone, from 100
to 300 m. wide, from Newfoundland, Gaspé Peninsula and New
Brunswick, 1500 m. south-westward to central Alabama. The
whole system may be divided into three great sections: the
<i>Northern</i>, from Newfoundland to the Hudson river; the <i>Central</i>,
from the Hudson Valley to that of New river (Great Kanawha),
in Virginia and West Virginia; and the <i>Southern</i>, from New
river onwards. The northern section includes the Shickshock
Mountains and Notre Dame Range in Quebec, scattered elevations
in Maine, the White Mountains and the Green Mountains;
the central comprises, besides various minor groups, the Valley
Ridges between the Front of the Allegheny Plateau and the
Great Appalachian Valley, the New York-New Jersey Highlands
and a large portion of the Blue Ridge; and the southern consists
of the prolongation of the Blue Ridge, the Unaka Range,
and the Valley Ridges adjoining the Cumberland Plateau, with
some lesser ranges.</p>

<p><i>The Chief Summits.</i>&mdash;The Appalachian belt includes, with the
ranges enumerated above, the plateaus sloping southward to the
Atlantic Ocean in New England, and south-eastward to the
border of the coastal plain through the central and southern
Atlantic states; and on the north-west, the Allegheny and
Cumberland plateaus declining toward the Great Lakes and the
interior plains. A remarkable feature of the belt is the longitudinal
chain of broad valleys&mdash;the Great Appalachian Valley&mdash;which,
in the southerly sections divides the mountain system
into two subequal portions, but in the northernmost lies west
of all the ranges possessing typical Appalachian features, and
separates them from the Adirondack group. The mountain
system has no axis of dominating altitudes, but in every portion
the summits rise to rather uniform heights, and, especially in
the central section, the various ridges and intermontane valleys
have the same trend as the system itself. None of the summits
reaches the region of perpetual snow. Mountains of the Long
Range in Newfoundland reach heights of nearly 2000 ft. In the
Shickshocks the higher summits rise to about 4000 ft. elevation.
In Maine four peaks exceed 3000 ft., including Katahdin (5200
ft.), Mount Washington, in the White Mountains (6293 ft.),
Adams (5805), Jefferson (5725), Clay (5554), Monroe (5390),
Madison (5380), Lafayette (5269); and a number of summits
rise above 4000 ft. In the Green Mountains the highest point,
Mansfield, is 4364 ft.; Lincoln (4078), Killington (4241), Camel
Hump (4088); and a number of other heights exceed 3000 ft.
The Catskills are not properly included in the system. The Blue
Ridge, rising in southern Pennsylvania and there known as
South Mountain, attains in that state elevations of about 2000
ft.; southward to the Potomac its altitudes diminish, but 30 m.
beyond again reach 2000 ft. In the Virginia Blue Ridge the
following are the highest peaks east of New river: Mount
Weather (about 1850 ft.), Mary&rsquo;s Rock (3523), Peaks of Otter
(4001 and 3875), Stony Man (4031), Hawks Bill (4066). In
Pennsylvania the summits of the Valley Ridges rise generally to
about 2000 ft., and in Maryland Eagle Rock and Dans Rock are
conspicuous points reaching 3162 ft. and 2882 ft. above the sea.
On the same side of the Great Valley, south of the Potomac,
are the Pinnacle (3007 ft.) and Pidgeon Roost (3400 ft.). In the
southern section of the Blue Ridge are Grandfather Mountain
(5964 ft.), with three other summits above 5000, and a dozen
more above 4000. The Unaka Ranges (including the Black
and Smoky Mountains) have eighteen peaks higher than 5000 ft.,
and eight surpassing 6000 ft. In the Black Mountains, Mitchell
(the culminating point of the whole system) attains an altitude
of 6711 ft., Balsam Cone, 6645, Black Brothers, 6690, and 6620,
and Hallback, 6403. In the Smoky Mountains we have Clingman&rsquo;s
Peak (6611), Guyot (6636), Alexander (6447), Leconte
(6612), Curtis (6588), with several others above 6000 and many
higher than 5000.</p>

<p>In spite of the existence of the Great Appalachian Valley, the
master streams are transverse to the axis of the system. The
main watershed follows a tortuous course which crosses the
mountainous belt just north of New river in Virginia; south of
this the rivers head in the Blue Ridge, cross the higher Unakas,
receive important tributaries from the Great Valley, and traversing
the Cumberland Plateau in spreading gorges, escape by
way of the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers to the Ohio and
Mississippi, and thus to the Gulf of Mexico; in the central section
the rivers, rising in or beyond the Valley Ridges, flow through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
great gorges (water gaps) to the Great Valley, and by south-easterly
courses across the Blue Ridge to tidal estuaries penetrating
the coastal plain; in the northern section the water-parting
lies on the inland side of the mountainous belt, the main lines of
drainage running from north to south.</p>

<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The rocks of the Appalachian belt fall naturally
into two divisions; ancient (pre-Cambrian) crystallines, including
marbles, schists, gneisses, granites and other massive igneous
rocks, and a great succession of Paleozoic sediments. The
crystallines are confined to the portion of the belt east of the
Great Valley where Paleozoic rocks are always highly metamorphosed
and occur for the most part in limited patches,
excepting in New England and Canada, where they assume
greater areal importance, and are besides very generally intruded
by granites. The Paleozoic sediments, ranging in age from
Cambrian to Permian, occupy the Great Valley, the Valley
Ridges and the plateaus still farther west. They are rarely
metamorphosed to the point of recrystallization, though locally
shales are altered to roofing slates, sandstones are indurated,
limestones slightly marblized, and coals, originally bituminous,
are changed to anthracite in northern Pennsylvania, and to
graphite in Rhode Island. Igneous intrusions consist only of
unimportant dikes of trap. The most striking and uniformly
characteristic geologic feature of the mountains is their internal
structure, consisting of innumerable parallel, long and narrow
folds, always closely appressed in the eastern part of any cross-section
(Piedmont Plateau to Great Valley), less so along a
central zone (Great Valley and Valley Ridges), and increasingly
open on the west (Allegheny and Cumberland Plateaus).
Asymmetry of the folds is a marked characteristic in the zones
of closer folding, the anticlines having long gently inclined
easterly limbs, and short, steep and even overturned limbs
upon the west. The effect of such folds is often exaggerated by
thrusts, and faulting of this sort is prominent in the southern
section, where the existence of over-thrusts measured by several
miles has been established.</p>

<p>What may be termed the ancestral Appalachian system was
formed during the post-carboniferous revolution, though certain
of its elements had been previously outlined, and perhaps at
different dates. Folding of the rocks resulted from the operation
of great compressive forces acting tangentially to the figure of
the earth. Extensive and deep-seated crumpling was necessarily
accompanied by vertical uplift throughout the zone affected,
but once at least since their birth the mountains have been worn
down to a lowland, and the mountains of to-day are the combined
product of subsequent uplift of a different sort, and dissection
by erosion. Produced by long-continued subaerial decay and
erosion, in later Cretaceous times this lowland extended from
the Atlantic Ocean well toward the interior of North America;
since then the whole continent has been generally elevated, and
by successive steps the Appalachian belt has been raised to form
a wide but relatively low arch. The crosswise courses of the
greater rivers result from the rivers being older than the mountains,
which indeed have been produced by circumdenudation.
The master streams of the present have inherited their channels
from the drainage systems of the Cretaceous lowland, and though
raised athwart the courses of the lowland trunk streams the
great arch was developed so slowly that these channels could be
maintained through <i>pari passu</i> deepening. Former tributaries
have given place to others developed with reference to the
distribution of more or less easily eroded strata, the present
longitudinal valleys being determined by the out-crop of soft
shales or soluble limestones, and the parallel ridges upheld by
hard sandstones or schists. Parallelism of mountain ridges
and intervening valleys is thus attributable to the folding of the
rocks, but the origin of the interior structure of the mountains
is to be kept distinct from the origin of the mountains as features
of topography.</p>

<p><i>Flora and Fauna.</i>&mdash;Much of the region is covered with forest
yielding quantities of valuable timber, especially in Canada and
northern New England. The most valuable trees for lumber
are spruce, white pine, hemlock, cedar, white birch, ash, maple
and basswood; all excepting pine and hemlock and poplar in
addition are ground into wood pulp for the manufacture of
paper. In the central and southern parts of the belt oak and
hickory constitute valuable hard woods, and certain varieties
of the former furnish quantities of tan bark. The tulip tree
produces a good clear lumber known as white wood or poplar,
and is also a source of pulp. In the south both white and yellow
pine abounds. Many flowering and fruit-bearing shrubs of the
heath family add to the beauty of the mountainous districts,
rhododendron and kalmia often forming impenetrable thickets.
Bears, mountain lions (pumas), wild cats (lynx) and wolves
haunt the more remote fastnesses of the mountains; foxes
abound; deer are found in many districts and moose in the
north.</p>

<p><i>Influence on History.</i>&mdash;For a century the Appalachians were a
barrier to the westward expansion of the English colonies; the
continuity of the system, the bewildering multiplicity of its
succeeding ridges, the tortuous courses and roughness of its
transverse passes, a heavy forest and dense undergrowth all
conspired to hold the settlers on the seaward-sloping plateaus
and coastal plains. Only by way of the Hudson and Mohawk
valleys, and round about the southern termination of the system
were there easy routes to the interior of the country, and these
were long closed by hostile aborigines and jealous French or
Spanish colonists. In eastern Pennsylvania the Great Valley
was accessible by reason of a broad gateway between the end of
South Mountain and the Highlands, and here in the Lebanon
Valley settled German Moravians, whose descendants even now
retain the peculiar patois known as &ldquo;Pennsylvania Dutch.&rdquo;
These were late comers to the New World forced to the frontier
to find unclaimed lands. With their followers of both German
and Scotch-Irish origin, they worked their way southward and
soon occupied all of the Virginia Valley and the upper reaches of
the Great Valley tributaries of the Tennessee. By 1755 the
obstacle to westward expansion had been thus reduced by half;
outposts of the English colonists had penetrated the Allegheny
and Cumberland plateaus, threatening French monopoly in the
transmontane region, and a conflict became inevitable. Making
common cause against the French to determine the control of
the Ohio valley, the unsuspected strength of the colonists was
revealed, and the successful ending of the French and Indian
War extended England&rsquo;s territory to the Mississippi. To this
strength the geographic isolation enforced by the Appalachian
mountains had been a prime contributor. The confinement of
the colonies between an ocean and a mountain wall led to the
fullest occupation of the coastal border of the continent, which
was possible under existing conditions of agriculture, conducing
to a community of purpose, a political and commercial solidarity,
which would not otherwise have been developed. As early as
1700 it was possible to ride from Portland, Maine, to southern
Virginia, sleeping each night at some considerable village. In
contrast to this complete industrial occupation, the French
territory was held by a small and very scattered population, its
extent and openness adding materially to the difficulties of a
disputed tenure. Bearing the brunt of this contest as they did,
the colonies were undergoing preparation for the subsequent
struggle with the home government. Unsupported by shipping,
the American armies fought toward the sea with the mountains
at their back protecting them against Indians leagued with the
British. The few settlements beyond the Great Valley were
free for self-defence because debarred from general participation
in the conflict by reason of their position.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APPANAGE,<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Apanage</span> (a French word from the late Lat.
<i>apanagium</i>, formed from <i>apanare, i.e. panem porrigere</i>, to give
bread, <i>i.e.</i> sustenance), in its original sense, the means of
subsistence given by parents to their younger children as distinct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
from the rights secured to the eldest born by the custom of
primogeniture. In its modern usage it is practically confined to
the money endowment given to the younger children of reigning
or mediatized houses in Germany and Austria, which reverts
to the state or to the head of the family on the extinction of the
line of the original grantee. In English history the system of
appanages never played any great part, and the term is now
properly applied only to the appanages of the crown: the duchy
of Cornwall, assigned to the king&rsquo;s eldest son at birth, or on his
father&rsquo;s accession to the crown, and the duchy of Lancaster.
In the history of France, however, the appanage was a very
important factor. The word denotes in very early French law
the portion of lands or money given by fathers and mothers to
their sons or daughters on marriage, and usually connotes a
renunciation by the latter of any future inheritance; or it may
denote the portion given by the eldest son to his brothers and
sisters when he was sole inheritor. The word <i>apanage</i> is still
employed in this sense in French official texts of some <i>Customs</i>;
but it was in old public law that it received its definite meaning
and importance. Under the kings of the third dynasty, the
division of the kingdom among the sons of the dead monarch
which had characterized the Merovingian and Carolingian
dynasties, ceased. The eldest son alone succeeded to the crown;
but at the same time a custom was established by which the king
made territorial provision suitable to their rank for his other
children or for his brothers and sisters; custom forbade their
being left landless. Lands and lordships thus bestowed constituted
the appanages, which interfered so greatly with the
formation of ancient France. While the persevering policy of
the Capets, which aimed at reuniting the great fiefs, duchies,
countships, baronies, &amp;c., to the domain of the crown, gradually
reconstructed for their benefit a territorial sovereignty over
France, the institution of the appanage periodically subtracted
large portions from it. Louis XI., in particular, had to struggle
against the appanaged nobles. The old law, however, never
abolished this institution. The edict of Moulins (1566) maintained
it, as one of the exceptions to the inalienability of the
crown-lands; only it was then decided that daughters of France
should be appanaged in money, or that if, in default of coin,
lands were assigned to them, these lands should be redeemable
by the crown in perpetuity. The efforts of the kings to minimize
this evil, and of the old jurisprudence to deal with the matter,
resulted in two expedients: (1) the reversion of the appanage
to the crown was secured as far as possible, being declared inalienable
and transmissible only to male descendants in the
male line of the person appanaged; (2) originally the person
appanaged had possessed all the rights of a duke or count&mdash;that
is to say, in the middle ages nearly all the attributes of
sovereignty; the more important of these attributes were now
gradually reserved to the monarch, including public authority
over the inhabitants of the appanage in all essential matters.
However, it is evident from the letters of appanage, dated April
1771, in favour of the count of Provence, how many functions
of public authority an appanaged person still held. The
Constituent Assembly, by the law dated the 22nd of November
1790, decided that in future there should be no appanages in
real estate, and that younger sons of monarchs, married and
over twenty-five years of age, should be provided for by yearly
grants (<i>rentes apanagères</i>) from the public funds. The laws of the
13th of August and the 21st of December 1790 revoked all the
existing appanages, except those of the Luxembourg Palace and
the Palais Royal. To each person hitherto appanaged an annual
income of one million <i>livres</i> was assigned, and two millions for the
brothers of the king. All this came to an end with the monarchy.
Napoleon, by the <i>sénatus-consulte</i> of the 30th of January 1810,
resolved to create appanages for the emperor&rsquo;s princely descendants,
such appanages to consist for the most part of lands on
French soil. The fall of the empire again annulled this enactment.
The last appanage known in France was that enjoyed
by the house of Orleans. Having been re-established, or
recognized as still existing, by the Restoration, it was formally
confirmed by the law of the 15th of January 1825. On the
accession of Louis Philippe it was united to the national property
by the law of the 2nd of March 1832.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APPAREL<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> (from O. Fr. <i>aparail</i>, <i>aparailler</i>, mod. <i>appareil</i>, from
Low Lat. <i>adpariculare</i>, to make fit or equal), equipment, outfit,
things furnished for the proper performance of anything, now
chiefly used of dress. The word is also applied to the &ldquo;orphreys,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> embroidered strips or borders, on ecclesiastical vestments.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APPARITIONS.<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> An apparition, strictly speaking, is merely
an appearance (Lat. <i>apparere</i>, to appear), the result of perception
exercised on any stimulus of any of the senses. But in ordinary
usage the word apparition denotes a perception (generally
through the sense of sight) which cannot, as a rule, be shown to
be occasioned by an object in external nature. We say &ldquo;as a
rule&rdquo; because many so-called apparitions are merely illusions,
<i>i.e.</i> misconstructions of the perceptive processes, as when a
person in a bad light sees a number of small children leading a
horse, and finds, on nearer approach, that he sees two men
carrying bee-hives suspended from a pole. Again, Sir Walter
Scott&rsquo;s vision of Byron, then lately dead, proved to be a misconstruction
of certain plaids and cloaks hanging in the hall at
Abbotsford, or so Sir Walter declared. Had he not discovered
the physical basis of this illusion (which, while it lasted, was an
apparition, technically speaking), he and others might have
thought that it was an apparition in the popular sense of the
word, a ghost. In popular phraseology a ghost is understood
to be a phantasm produced in some way by the spirit of a dead
person, the impression being usually visual, though the ghost,
or apparition, may also affect the sense of hearing (by words,
knocks, whistles, groans and so forth), or the sense of touch,
or of weight, as in the case of the &ldquo;incubus.&rdquo; In ordinary
speech an apparition of a person not known to the percipient
to be dead is called a wraith, in the Highland phrase, a spirit of
the living. The terms <i>ghost</i> and <i>wraith</i> involve the hypothesis
that the false perceptions are caused by spirits, a survival of the
archaic animistic hypothesis (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Animism</a></span>), an hypothesis as
difficult to prove as to disprove. Apparitions, of course, are not
confined to anthropomorphic phantasms; we hear of phantom
coaches (sometimes seen, but more frequently heard), of phantom
dogs, cats, horses, cattle, deer, and even of phantom houses.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the causes of these and other false perceptions,&mdash;most
curious when the impression is shared by several
witnesses,&mdash;they may best be considered under the head of
hallucination (<i>q.v.</i>). Hallucinations may be pathological, <i>i.e.</i>
the result of morbid conditions of brain or nerve, of disease, of
fever, of insanity, of alcoholism, of the abuse of drugs. Again,
they may be the result of dissociation, or may occur in the
borderland of sleep or waking, and in this case they partake
of the hallucinatory nature of dreams (<i>q.v.</i>). Again, hallucinations
may, once or twice in a lifetime, come into the experience
of the sane, the healthy, and, as far as any tests can be applied,
of the wide-awake. In such instances the apparition (whether
it take the form of a visual phantasm, of a recognized voice, of a
touch, or what not) may be coincidental or non-coincidental.
The phantasm is called coincidental if it represents a known and
distant person who is later found to have been dying or in some
other crisis at the moment of the percipient&rsquo;s experience. When
the false perception coincides with nothing of the sort, it is
styled non-coincidental. Coincidental apparitions have been
explained by the theory of telepathy (<i>q.v.</i>), one mind or brain
impressing another in some unknown way so as to beget an
hallucinatory apparition or phantasm. On the evidence, so far
as it has been collected and analysed, it seems that the mind
which, on the hypothesis, begets the hallucinations, usually
does so without <i>conscious</i> effort (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Subliminal Self</a></span>). There
are, however, a few cases in which the experiment of begetting,
in another, an hallucination from a distance, is said to have been
experimentally and consciously made, with success.</p>

<p>If the telepathic theory of coincidental hallucinations be
accepted, we have still to account for the much more common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
non-coincidental apparitions of the living who do not happen
to be in any particular crisis. In these instances it cannot be
demonstrated that telepathy has <i>not</i> been at work, as when a
person is seen at a place which he thought of visiting, but did
not visit. F.W. Myers even upheld a theory of psychorhagy,
holding that the spirits of some persons have a way of manifesting
themselves at a distance by a psychic invasion. This involves,
as he remarked, paleolithic psychology, and the old savage
doctrine of animism, rather than telepathy (see Myers, <i>Human
Personality</i>). Of belief in coincidental hallucinations or wraiths
among savages, records are scanty; the belief, however, is found
among Maoris and Fuegians (see Lang, <i>Making of Religions</i>).
The perception of apparitions of distant but actual scenes and
occurrences is usually called clairvoyance (<i>q.v.</i>). The belief is
also familiar under the name of second sight (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Second Sight</a></span>),
a term of Scots usage, though the belief in it, and the facts
if accepted, are of world-wide diffusion. The apparitions may
either represent actual persons and places, or may be symbolical,
taking the form of phantasmic lights, coffins, skeletons, shrouds
and so forth. Again, the appearances may either represent
things, persons and occurrences of the past (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Retrocognition</a></span>),
or of the present (clairvoyance), or of the future (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Premonition</a></span>). When the apparitions produce themselves in
given rooms, houses or localities, and are exhibited to various
persons at various times, the locality is popularly said to be
haunted by spirits, that is, of the dead, on the animistic hypothesis
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hauntings</a></span>). Like the other alleged facts, these
are of world-wide diffusion, or the belief in them is world-wide,
and peculiar to no race, age, or period of culture. A haunted
place is a centre of permanent possibilities of hallucinations, or is
believed to be so. A distinct species of hauntings are those in
which unexplained sounds and movements of objects, apparently
untouched, occur. The German term <i>Poltergeist</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) has been
given to the supposed cause of these occurrences where the
cause is not ascertained to be sportive imposture. In the performances
of modern spiritualists the Poltergeist appears, as it
were, to be domesticated, and to come at the call of the medium.</p>

<p>An intermittent kind of ominous haunting attached, not to
places, but to families, is that of the banshee (Celtic) or family
death omen, such as the white bird of the Oxenhams, the Airlie
drummer, the spectral rider of Clan Gilzean, the rappings of the
Woodde family. These apparitions, with fairies and <i>djinns</i>
(the Arab form of fairy), haunt the borderland between folk-lore
and psychical research.</p>

<p>So far we have been concerned with spontaneous apparitions,
or with the belief in them. Among induced apparitions may be
reckoned the materialized forms of spiritual <i>séances</i>, which have
a material basis of veils, false moustaches, wigs and the <i>corpus
vile</i> of the medium. It is also possible that mere expectancy
and suggestion induce hallucinatory perceptions among the
members of the circle. That apparitions of a sort can be induced
by hypnotic and posthypnotic suggestion is certain enough (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hypnotism</a></span>). Savages produce apparitions in similar ways by
suggestion, accompanied by dances, fumigations, darkness,
fasting, drugs, and whatever can affect the imaginations of the
onlookers (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Magic</a></span>). Both in savage and civilized life, some
persons can provoke themselves into beholding apparitions
usually fantastic, but occasionally coincidental, by sedulously
staring into any clear deep water, a fragment of rock crystal, a
piece of polished basalt or obsidian, a mirror, a ring, a sword
blade, or a glass of sherry (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Crystal Gazing</a></span>). Indeed any
object, a wall, the palm of the hand, the shoulder-blade-bone of a
sheep, may be, and has been used to this end (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Divination</a></span>).</p>

<p>Almost all known apparitions may accommodate themselves
to one or other of the categories given, whether they be pathological,
coincidental or spontaneous, induced, permanently
localized, or sporadic.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APPARITOR,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Apparator</span> (Latin for a servant of a public
official, from <i>apparere</i>, to attend in public), an attendant who
executed the orders of a Roman magistrate; hence a beadle in a
university, a pursuivant or herald; particularly, in English
ecclesiastical courts, the official who serves the processes of the

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APPEAL,<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> in law. In the old English common law the term
&ldquo;appeal&rdquo; was used to describe a process peculiar to English
criminal procedure. It was a right of prosecution possessed as a
personal privilege by a party individually aggrieved by a felony,
a privilege of which the crown could not directly or indirectly
deprive him, since he could use it alike when the prisoner was
tried and acquitted, and when he was convicted and pardoned.
It was chiefly known in practice as the privilege of the nearest
relation of a murdered person. When in 1729 (after Colonel
Oglethorpe&rsquo;s inquiry and report on the London prisons) Banbridge
and other gaolers were indicted for their treatment of
prisoners, but were acquitted for deficiency of evidence, appeals
for murder were freely brought by relatives of deceased prisoners.
In the case of Slaughterford (1708) the accused was charged with
murdering a woman whom he had seduced; the evidence was
very imperfect, and he was acquitted on indictment. But
public indignation being aroused by the atrocities alleged to
have been perpetrated, an appeal was brought, and on conviction
he was hanged, as his execution was a privilege belonging to the
prosecutor, of which the crown could not deprive him by a
pardon. In 1818 an appeal was ingeniously met by an offer of
battle, since if the appellee were an able-bodied man he had the
choice between combat or a jury (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Wager</a></span>). This neutralizing
of one obsolete and barbarous process by another called the
attention of the legislature to the subject, and appeal in criminal
cases, along with trial by battle, was abolished in 1819. The
history of this appeal is fully dealt with in Pollock and Maitland,
<i>History of English Law</i>, 1898.</p>

<p>In its usual modern sense the term appeal is applied to the
proceeding by which the decision of a court of justice is brought
for review before another tribunal of higher authority. In
Roman jurisprudence it was used in this and in other significations;
it was sometimes equivalent to prosecution, or the calling
up of an accused person before a tribunal where the accuser
appealed to the protection of the magistrate against injustice or
oppression. The derivation from <i>appellare</i> (&ldquo;call&rdquo;) suggests
that its earliest meaning was an urgent outcry or prayer against
injustice. During the republic the magistrate was generally
supreme within his sphere, and those who felt themselves outraged
by injustice threw themselves on popular protection by
<i>provocatio</i>, instead of looking to redress from a higher official
authority. Under the empire different grades of jurisdiction
were established, and the ultimate remedy was an appeal to
the emperor; thus Paul, when brought before Festus, appealed
unto Caesar. Such appeals were, however, not heard by the
emperor in person but by a supreme judge representing him.
In the <i>Corpus Juris</i> the appeal to the emperor is called indiscriminately
<i>appellatio</i> and <i>provocatio</i>. A considerable portion
of the 49th book of the <i>Pandects</i> is devoted to appeals; but
little of the practical operation of the system is to be deduced
from the propositions there brought together.</p>

<p>During the middle ages full scope was afforded for appeals
from the lower to the higher authorities in the church. In
matters ecclesiastical, including those matrimonial, testamentary
and other departments, which the church ever tried to bring
within the operation of the canon law, there were various grades
of appeal, ending with the pope. The claims of the church to
engross appeals in matters trenching on the temporal rights of
princes led to continual conflicts between church and state,
terminated in England at the reformation by the suppression in
1534 of appeals to Rome, which had previously been discouraged
by legislation of Edward III. and Richard II.</p>

<p>In temporal, as distinct from spiritual matters, it became
customary for ambitious sovereigns to encourage appeals from
the courts of the crown vassals to themselves as represented by
the supreme judges, and Charlemagne usually enjoys the credit
of having set the example of this system of centralization by
establishing <i>missi dominici</i>. It is not improbable that his claim
was suggested or justified by the practice of the Roman empire,
to the sovereignty whereof he claimed to be successor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span></p>

<p><i>England.</i>&mdash;When the royal authority in England grew strong
as against that of the tenants <i>in capite</i>, the king&rsquo;s courts in
England were more effectively organized, and their net swept
wider so as to draw within their cognizance matters previously
adjudged in courts baron or courts leet or in the county court,
and they acquired authority to supervise and review the decisions
of the inferior and local courts, to control and limit their claims
to exercise jurisdiction, and to transfer causes from the local to
the royal courts. The machinery by which this process was
usually effected, under the common law, was not by what is now
known as appeal, but by the process of <i>certiorari</i> or writs of
error or prohibition. Recourse was also had against the decisions
of the royal courts by appeal to the great council of the king, or
to parliament as a whole. The supremacy of the king&rsquo;s courts
over all causes, as well ecclesiastical as civil, has been completely
established since the reign of Henry VIII., and they have
effectually asserted the power to regulate and keep within their
proper jurisdiction all other tribunals within the realm. Since
that date the organization of judicial tribunals has gradually
been changed and improved with the object (1) of creating a
judicial hierarchy independent of executive control; (2) of
ensuring that all decisions on questions of law shall be co-ordinated
and rendered systematic by correction of the errors and vagaries
of subordinate tribunals; and (3) of securing so far as possible
uniformity in the judicial interpretation and administration of
the law, by creating a supreme appellate tribunal to whose
decisions all other tribunals are bound to conform. It would be
undesirable to detail at length the history of appellate jurisdiction
in England, involving as it would the discussion in great
detail of the history and procedure of English law, and it may
suffice to indicate the system of appeals as at present organized,
beginning with the lowest courts.</p>

<p><i>Justices of the Peace.</i>&mdash;The decisions of justices of the peace
sitting as courts of summary jurisdiction are subject to review
on questions of law only by the High Court of Justice. This
review is in a sense consultative, because it is usually effected by
means of a case voluntarily stated by the justices at the request
of the aggrieved party, in which are set forth the facts as determined
by the justices, the questions of law raised and their
decision thereon, as to the correctness whereof the opinion of the
High Court is invited. The procedure is equally open in criminal
and civil matters brought before the justices. But when the
justices decline to state a case for the opinion of the High Court,
the latter, if review seems desirable, may order the justices to
state a case. And the High Court has also power to control the
action of justices by prohibiting them from acting in a case
beyond their jurisdiction, ordering them to exercise jurisdiction
where they have improperly declined (<i>mandamus</i>), or bringing
up for review and quashing orders or convictions which they have
made in excess of jurisdiction, or in cases in which interested
or biassed justices have adjudicated (<i>certiorari</i>). None of these
regulative processes exactly corresponds to what is popularly
known as an appeal, but in effect if not in form an appeal is
thus given.</p>

<p>There is also another form of appeal, in the fullest sense of
the term, from the decision of justices sitting as a court of
summary jurisdiction to the justices of the same county sitting
in general or quarter sessions, or in the case of a borough to
the recorder as judge of the borough court of quarter sessions.
This form of appeal is in every case the creation of statute:
and even in text-books it is hardly possible to find a really
complete list of the matters in respect of which such appeal
lies. But as regards criminal cases there is an approximately
general rule, given by § 19 of the Summary Jurisdiction Act
1879, viz. that an appeal to quarter sessions lies from the conviction
or order of a court of summary jurisdiction directing
imprisonment without the option of a fine as a punishment for
an offence, or for failing to do or to abstain from doing any
act required to be done or left undone other than an order for
the payment of money, or to find sureties or give security or to
enter into a recognizance, or a conviction made on a plea of
guilty or admission of the truth of the matter of complaint.</p>

<p>As a general rule, subject to particular statutory exceptions,
appeals of this kind are by way of rehearing, <i>i.e.</i> the actor or
prosecutor must before the appellate tribunal call his witnesses
and prove his case just as if no previous hearing had taken
place before the court appealed from (Pritchard, <i>Quarter Sessions
Practice</i>, 2nd ed., 461). The only limit is that the appellant
must confine himself to the grounds of appeal stated in the notice
of appeal given by him.</p>

<p><i>Justices in Quarter Sessions.</i>&mdash;This tribunal has under the
commission of the peace and under statute power to refer
questions of difficulty arising before it for decision to the High
Court. The old mode of exercising this power was by sending
on to assizes indictments raising difficult questions which had
been presented at quarter sessions. The High Court has <i>ex
officio</i> power to transfer such indictments where the nature of the
case and the demands of justice call for such transfer. The
quarter sessions had also power under statute on trying an
indictment to refer to the court for crown cases reserved
(Crown Cases Act 1848), abolished by the Criminal Appeal Act
1907, questions of law which had arisen at the trial, and in all
civil cases the quarter sessions has power of its own volition
and subject to no direct compulsion to consult the High Court
on legal questions of difficulty which have arisen. Until 1894
this jurisdiction was regarded as consultative only. It was and
is exercised by stating the facts, of which the court of quarter
sessions is the sole judge, and indicating the questions of law
arising on the facts, and the view of quarter sessions thereon,
and inviting the opinion of the High Court. Under the Judicature
Act 1894 cases stated in this way are now treated as
&ldquo;appeals&rdquo; in the popular sense.</p>

<p><i>Inferior Courts of purely Civil Jurisdiction.</i>&mdash;An appeal also
lies as a general rule to the High Court from the judgment of a
county court or of any inferior tribunal having civil jurisdiction.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) County Courts. Any party to an action or matter in a
county court who is dissatisfied with the determination or
direction of the judge in law or equity, or upon the admission or
rejection of any evidence, may appeal against the decision in the
following cases: (1) if the amount of claim or counter-claim in
the proceeding exceeds £20; or (2) in all equity matters or cases
in which an injunction has been given; or (3) in actions to
recover possession of land where questions of title are involved
(County Courts Act 1888, § 120). In the case of a claim below
£20 no appeal lies except by the leave of the county court.
The old practice of appeal by way of special case as in appeals
from justices has been abolished, and the present procedure is by
notice of motion (R.S.C. O. LIX. rr. 10-18).</p>

<p>These appeals are heard in the king&rsquo;s bench division, except
in the case of appeals from judgments of a county court sitting
in the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction, which are heard by
two or more judges sitting in the probate, divorce and admiralty
division. The chancery division has never sat to hear
&ldquo;appeals&rdquo; from a county court exercising equity jurisdiction;
but at times, by <i>prohibition</i> or <i>certiorari</i>, has, in effect, reviewed
or restrained excess of jurisdiction by county courts in equity
matters.</p>

<p>The decision of the High Court on county court appeals is
final unless an appeal to the court of appeal is brought by
leave of that court or of the High Court (Judicature Act 1894,
§ 1, sub. sect. 5; Judicature Act 1873, § 45).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Other inferior courts of civil jurisdiction. Appeals from
the local courts of record which still survive in certain cities,
towns and districts are in a somewhat anomalous position. The
general rule is that, unless a statute regulates such appeal, it
may be brought in the king&rsquo;s bench division of the High Court
on notice of motion in any case in which, before the Judicature
Acts, the court of king&rsquo;s bench could have reviewed the decision
of the inferior court by writ of error. The history of this question
is dealt with in <i>Darlow</i> v. <i>Shuttleworth</i>, 1902, 1 K.B. 721.</p>

<p>In the case of the mayor&rsquo;s court of London, under the local
and general statutes regulating that court, the appeal is usually
to the king&rsquo;s bench division, but where there is what is termed
&ldquo;error&rdquo; on the face of the proceedings of the mayor&rsquo;s court,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
the appeal lies direct to the court of appeal as successor of the
court of exchequer chamber. Appeals from the Liverpool court
of passage and from the chancery courts of the duchies of
Lancaster and Durham lie by statute direct to the court of
appeal.</p>

<p><i>High Court of Justice.</i>&mdash;Until the Supreme Court of Judicature
Acts of 1873 and 1875 came into operation, the superior courts
in England were imperfectly co-ordinated both as to jurisdiction
and appeals. The effect of these acts was to create a Supreme
Court of Judicature divided into two main branches, the High
Court of Justice, which is an appellate court with respect to the
inferior courts already mentioned, and to certain other special
courts and persons; and the court of appeal, which is mainly
concerned with appeals from the High Court of Justice.</p>

<p>The High Court of Justice acts as an appellate court or court
of consultation with reference to courts of summary jurisdiction
or quarter sessions and to county courts and other inferior
courts of civil jurisdiction in the cases already indicated. The
three divisions of the court are somewhat differently placed
with reference to appeals.</p>

<p>In the chancery division (made up, in 1908, of six single
judge courts) no appeals are heard except from subordinate
officials (masters) of the court, or an occasional interference
by <i>certiorari</i> or <i>prohibition</i> with a county court.</p>

<p>In the probate, divorce and admiralty division, besides
the supervision which may be exercised by a single judge over
the subordinate officers of the court (registrars), divisional
courts (of two judges) hear appeals from decisions of the county
court in admiralty causes, and appeals from justices in cases
between husband and wife under the Summary Jurisdiction
(Married Women) Act 1895, as amended by the Licensing Act
1902. In the first of these cases the appeal is on law only as
in the case of other county court appeals; in the second, the
procedure is by rehearing, or reconsideration of the facts
as minuted in the court appealed from, and of the law there
applied to these facts.</p>

<p>The bulk of the appellate work of the High Court is conducted
in the king&rsquo;s bench division&mdash;which, as successor of the old
court of king&rsquo;s bench in the duties of <i>custos morum</i> of the
realm, still retains supervisory power over all inferior courts
in all cases in which that supervision has not been transferred
to the other divisions of the High Court or to the court of appeal,
or to the court of criminal appeal.</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s bench division exercises appellate jurisdiction
in the following cases.</p>

<p>With respect to decisions of justices of the peace sitting at
quarter sessions, or as a court of summary jurisdiction, except
in the case above stated, the subject matter of appeal is for
the most part of a criminal or quasi-criminal character, the civil
jurisdiction of justices being comparatively limited. The
appeal in such cases is as to matters of law only, the justices&rsquo;
decision on facts not being subject to review.</p>

<p>In the case of the courts above named, the appeal is brought
by writ of <i>certiorari</i>, where the jurisdiction of quarter sessions
to give the judgment challenged is denied <i>in toto</i>, or in some cases
by writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, where the appellant is in custody
under an order of the court appealed from (Judicature Act
1894, § 2). The best example of this is the right of a fugitive
criminal committed for extradition to challenge the legality
of the decision of the committing magistrate by writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>. Save in cases of want of jurisdiction or refusal to
exercise it, no appeal lies from quarter sessions except by consent
of the court appealed from, which states the facts as ascertained
by the inferior court, and invites the review of the superior
court upon the questions of law raised by the facts as found.</p>

<p>Decisions of justices sitting in the exercise of summary
jurisdiction are subject to review by a special case in which
the justices state the facts found by them and their decision
on the points of law, and invite the review of the appellate
court on these grounds. Such cases for appeal are usually
stated by consent of the justices, but in the event of their
refusal the appellate court may order that a case shall be stated.</p>

<p>Decisions of justices in the exercise of summary jurisdiction
may also be challenged by writ of <i>certiorari</i> as having been
wholly outside their jurisdiction; and in such proceeding
the appellate tribunal may review the evidence taken below
so far as to ascertain whether the justices have by an erroneous
finding of fact enabled themselves to assume a jurisdiction
which upon the true facts they did not possess.</p>

<p>Where the decision appealed from is in a criminal cause
or matter the decision of the High Court is final. Where it
is in a civil matter a further appeal also lies to the court of
appeal by leave of the High Court or of the court of appeal
(Judicature Act 1873, § 45).</p>

<p>Appeals in criminal cases tried on indictment, criminal
information or coroner&rsquo;s inquisition, stand on a different footing
from other appeals.</p>

<p>For many years the question of criminal appeal in general
had been a matter of great controversy. As early as 1844 a
bill had been unsuccessfully introduced for the purpose of
establishing appeal in criminal cases, and from that time up
to 1906 nearly thirty bills were brought forward with the same
object, but none succeeded in passing. In 1892 the question
was referred to the council of judges and favourably reported
upon by them. It may be remarked that England was practically
the only civilized country in which there was no appeal
in criminal cases. It is true there was an appeal on questions
of law arising at the trial. But the procedure was intricate
and technical, being either (1) by writ of error, issued by the
consent of the attorney-general (expressed by his <i>fiat</i>), to review
errors of law appearing in the record of the trial, or (2) by special
case, stated by the judge presiding at the trial, with respect
to a question of law raised at the trial. These appeals were
heard by the king&rsquo;s bench division. Meanwhile there had
been a considerable development of public opinion in favour
of the establishment of criminal appeal, a development
undoubtedly hastened by the report of a committee of inquiry
in the case of Adolf Beck (1904), showing clearly that the home
office was not a satisfactory tribunal of final appeal. In 1906
the lord chancellor (Lord Loreburn) introduced another criminal
appeal bill, which passed the House of Lords, but was dropped
in the House of Commons after a first reading. The next year
the act (Criminal Appeal Act 1907), which was ultimately
carried, was introduced into the House of Commons. By this
act a court is established consisting of the lord chief justice
and eight judges of the king&rsquo;s bench division, the jurisdiction
of the court for crown cases reserved being transferred to the
new court. The court to be duly constituted must consist
of not less than three judges and of an uneven number of judges.
The court may sit in two or more divisions if the lord chief
justice so directs. Its sittings are held in London unless special
directions are given by the lord chief justice that it shall sit
at some other place. The opinion of the majority of those
hearing the case determines any question before the court,
and judgment is pronounced by the president (who is the lord
chief justice or senior member present), unless in questions
of law, when, if it is convenient that separate judgments should
be pronounced by the members of the court, they may be so
pronounced. The judgment of the court of criminal appeal
is final, except where the decision involves a point of law of
exceptional public importance, and a certificate must be obtained
from the attorney-general to that effect. The court of criminal
appeal is a superior court of record. An appeal may be made
either against conviction or against sentence. A person convicted
on indictment may appeal either on a question of law alone
or of fact alone, or on a question of mixed law and fact. On
a point of law a prisoner has an unqualified right of appeal,
on a question of fact or of mixed law and fact there is a right
of appeal only if leave be obtained from the court of criminal
appeal or a certificate be granted by the judge who tried the
prisoner that it is a fit case for appeal. The court is given a
wide discretion as to whether a conviction may be sustained
or set aside. The court may allow the appeal if they think
that the verdict of the jury should be set aside because it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
unreasonable, or because it cannot be supported having regard
to the evidence, or that the judgment should be set aside
on the ground of a wrong decision on any point of law, or
that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice. Power is
given to the court to dismiss the appeal if they consider that no
substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred, even though
they are of opinion that the point raised in the appeal
might be decided in favour of the appellant. The sentence
passed at the trial may be quashed by the appeal court and
such other sentence (whether more or less severe) warranted
in law by the verdict substituted. Notice of appeal or notice
of application for leave to appeal must be given within ten
days of the date of conviction; where a conviction involves
sentence of death or corporal punishment the sentence must
not be executed until after the expiration of ten days, and, if
notice of appeal is given, not until after the determination
of the appeal or the final dismissal of the application for leave
to appeal. The act gives the court power to order any witnesses
who would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to attend
and be examined before the court, and to receive the evidence,
if tendered, of any witness who is a competent but not compellable
witness. If any question arises on the appeal involving
prolonged examination of documents or accounts or any scientific
or local investigation, which the court thinks cannot be conveniently
conducted before it, the matter may be referred to
a special commissioner appointed by the court, and the court
may act on the report of that commissioner if it thinks fit.
An appellant is given the right to be present on the hearing
of his appeal, if he desires it, except where the appeal is on
some ground involving a question of law alone, but rules of court
may provide for his presence in such a case, or the court may give
him leave. The act requires shorthand notes to be taken of
the proceedings at the trial of any person, who, if convicted,
would have a right to appeal under the act. Nothing in the act
affects the prerogative of mercy, and the home secretary may,
if he thinks fit, at any time refer a case to the court of criminal
appeal.</p>

<p><i>The Court of Appeal.</i>&mdash;The court of appeal, constituted under
the Judicature Acts, is one of the two permanent divisions of the
Supreme Court of Judicature. As now constituted the court
consists of <i>ex officio</i> members and five ordinary members, styled
lords justices of appeal. The <i>ex officio</i> members are the lord
chancellor, every person who has held that office, the lord chief
justice, the master of the rolls, and the president of the probate,
&amp;c., division.</p>

<p>The ordinary business of the court is carried on by the lords
justices under the presidency of the master of the rolls, who in
1881 ceased to be a judge of the High Court (Judicature Act
1881, § 2). The court usually sits in two divisions of three
judges, but on occasion a third court can be formed, with the
assistance of the other <i>ex officio</i> judges, in the absence of the
ordinary judges from illness or public engagements, or to deal
with arrears of business. The quorum for final appeals is three,
for interlocutory appeals two judges.</p>

<p>The court of appeal has succeeded to the appellate authority
exercised (1) in the case of equity and bankruptcy matters by
the lord chancellor and the lords justices of appeal in chancery
(Judicature Act 1873, § 18); (2) in the case of common law
matters, by the court of exchequer chamber, as a court of error,
and the superior courts of common law sitting to review the
decisions of single judges of these courts sitting with or without
a jury at first instance in civil actions; (3) in the case of divorce
or probate causes by the full court of divorce (Judicature Act
1881, § 9); (4) in the case of admiralty causes by the king in
council or the judicial committee of the privy council; (5) in
the case of applications for new trials in jury actions by the
king&rsquo;s bench division (Judicature Act 1890, § 1).</p>

<p>The court never had jurisdiction to hear an appeal in any
criminal cause or matter, but was able to review by writ of error
decisions of the king&rsquo;s bench division in such cases, unless the
court for crown cases reserved had dealt with the question
under the Crown Cases Act 1848. This procedure has been
abolished by the Criminal Appeal Act 1907. Instances of
procedure by writ of error were rare. Those best worth notice
are the cases of the Tichborne claimant on his conviction of
perjury, and the case of C. Bradlaugh on the sufficiency of the
indictment against him for publishing the <i>Fruits of Philosophy</i>.</p>

<p>The appellate jurisdiction of the court as now exercised
entitles the court to hear and determine (1) appeals from every
judgment or decree of every division of the High Court in all
civil cases in which such judgment is not declared final by
statute; (2) applications for a new trial in civil cases tried in
the king&rsquo;s bench division by judge and jury which, until 1890,
were dealt with by two or more judges in that division; (3)
appeals in matters of civil practice and procedure from decisions
of a single judge in chambers, which, until 1894, were dealt with
in a divisional court or by a judge in open court; (4) appeals
from the chancery courts of Durham (Palatine Court of Durham
Act 1889) and Lancaster (act of 1890, c. 23) and the Liverpool
court of passage (<i>Anderson v. Dean</i>, 1894, 2 Q.B. 222), and on
error in a record of the mayor&rsquo;s court of London (<i>Le Blanche</i> v.
<i>Heaton Telegram Co.</i>, 1876, 1 Ex.D. 408); and from county
courts under the Agricultural Holdings Acts and Workmen&rsquo;s
Compensation Acts; (5) appeals on questions of law from
decisions of the railway commissioners in England (Railway and
Canal Traffic Act 1888).</p>

<p>The court of appeal also exercises the lunacy jurisdiction of the
lord chancellor, but in regard to this the jurisdiction of the court
is for the most part original and not appellate.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction of the court of appeal is excluded or limited
in the following cases:&mdash;(1) judgments of the High Court&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
where its jurisdiction is consultative only; (<i>b</i>) where there is an
appeal to the High Court from an inferior court of civil jurisdiction;
(<i>c</i>) where there is an appeal to the High Court from any
court of person, unless in cases (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) leave be obtained
of the court by which the order is made, or of the court of appeal;
(2) orders of the High Court in registration and election cases
except with the like leave; (3) orders made by consent of parties,
or as to costs only which by law are left to the discretion of the
court; (4) certain interlocutory orders mentioned in § 1 of
the Supreme Court of Judicature (Procedure) Act 1894, except
by leave of the judge appealed from or of the court of appeal
(5) orders of the admiralty division in cases of prize, the appeal
from which lies to His Majesty in Council; (6) where the decision
of any court whose jurisdiction was transferred to the High Court
is declared by statute to be final; (7) matters which from their
nature were not appealable to any court before the Judicature
Acts, or in which the court of appeal has no means of enforcing
or executing its judgment. For example, it was held in the
House of Lords, in <i>Cox</i> v. <i>Hakes</i>, 1890, 15 A.C. 506, that no
appeal lies from the order of a judge discharging a prisoner under
a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; said Lord Herschell, &ldquo;the contention
of the respondent is to prevail, the statute has effected a
grave constitutional change&rdquo;; and later, &ldquo;if&rdquo; the High Court
&ldquo;has inherited the combined powers of the courts whose functions
were transferred to it, but none of them had any jurisdiction or
authority to review a discharge by a competent court under a
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, or to enforce the arrest of one thus freed
from custody ... it seems to me to follow, that however wrong
the court of appeal might think a discharge to have been, it
would have been powerless to order a rearrest, or at least to
enforce such an order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The procedure of the court of appeal is regulated by the rules
of the Supreme Court. A distinction is drawn between appeals
from a final judgment or order (which, unless the parties consent
to a smaller quorum, must be heard by three judges) and an
appeal from an interlocutory order (which may be determined
by two judges of the court of appeal).</p>

<p>In the case of appeals from a final or interlocutory &ldquo;judgment,&rdquo;
or from an order, including applications for a new trial,
the appeal must be brought within three months from the time
when the judgment or order is signed, entered or otherwise
perfected, or in the case of refusal of an application from the
date of refusal. The appeal is by notice of motion, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>214</span>
except in cases of application for a new trial, need not state
the grounds of appeal. Fourteen clear days&rsquo; notice of the
motion must be given by the appellant to the other party, the
respondent.</p>

<p>In the case of appeals from an interlocutory order, or from a
final order, or from an order made in any matter which is not an
action, or from an order made in chambers, the appeal must be
brought within fourteen days by motion, of which four clear
days&rsquo; notice must be given by the appellant to all parties directly
affected by the appeal. Controversies have arisen as to the
meaning of the term &ldquo;interlocutory,&rdquo; which (in the absence of
any authoritative definition) the court of appeal settles as they
arise. The test most generally accepted is that a judgment or
order is final if, as made, it finally disposes of the rights of the
parties in a manner equally conclusive between them. The
court may by special leave allow appeals of either class to be
brought after the time above limited. The respondent may by
proper notice bring a cross appeal against any portion of the
judgment or order made below with which he is dissatisfied.
The court has power to order the appellant to find security for
the costs of an appeal, if special circumstances, such as insolvency
or poverty or foreign domicile or the like, make the
giving of security desirable. The court of appeal &ldquo;rehears&rdquo;
the case. Under ordinary circumstances it does not permit a
new case to be set up inconsistent with the case as presented
below; and it is content with the judges&rsquo; notes, or a transcript
of the evidence given below, and with a note or transcript of the
judgment appealed from, but has power on special grounds to
receive fresh evidence either <i>viva voce</i> or on affidavit. The court
may call in for its assistance assessors who are experts on the
matters of fact or science involved in the appeal, and usually
does so in cases arising out of collisions at sea.</p>

<p>The court of appeal may make any order which it deems just
as to the costs of the whole or any part of an appeal, except
possibly in the case of certain appeals in matters on the crown
side of the High Court, as to which some doubt still exists. In
practice the costs follow the event, unless the court in a particular
case makes an order to the contrary.</p>

<p>A decision of the court of appeal is final in appeals from
the High Court in bankruptcy, unless leave be given to appeal
to the House of Lords (§ 104, Bankruptcy Act 1883), and in
divorce appeals, except where the decision either is upon the
grant or refusal of a decree for dissolution or nullity of marriage,
or for a declaration of legitimacy, or is upon any question of law
on which the court gives leave to appeal (Supreme Court of
Judicature Act 1881, § 9); but no further appeal to the House
of Lords lies, even with leave of the court of appeal, on appeals
from the High Court sitting as a court of appeal from county
courts in bankruptcy. With these exceptions there is now a right
of appeal from every order of the court of appeal to the House
of Lords.</p>

<p><i>The House of Lords.</i>&mdash;The House of Lords has for centuries
been the court of last resort, and is still the final court of appeal
from the chief courts in the United Kingdom. The origin of the
appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords was undoubtedly
of that partly feudal and partly popular character already
alluded to, which made the suitor seek from the high court of
parliament the justice denied elsewhere in the baronial courts or
by the king&rsquo;s judges. The lords exercised the mixed function of
jurymen and judges, and, as in judgments on impeachment,
might be influenced by private or party considerations, debating
and dividing on the question before the House. A revolution
was silently accomplished, however, by which the function of
reviewing the decisions of the courts fell entirely to the lawyers
raised to the peerage, while the unprofessional lords only attended
to give the sanction of a quorum to the proceedings, and the
House has always had the right to invoke the assistance of the
judges of the superior courts to advise on the questions of law
raised by an appeal. The letters and memoirs, so late as Queen
Anne&rsquo;s reign, show that party or personal influence and persuasion
were employed to procure votes on appeals, as they have
been in later times on railway or other local bills. The last
instance probably in which a strong division of opinion was
manifested among the unprofessional lords was the celebrated
Douglas cause in 1769, when the House was addressed by the
dukes of Newcastle and Bedford, but was led by the authoritative
opinion of Lord Mansfield on the effect of the evidence&mdash;an
opinion which was treated rather as that of a political partisan
than of a judge. The case of Daniel O&rsquo;Connell and others,
brought up on writ of error from the queen&rsquo;s bench in Ireland
in 1844, may be said to have finally established the precedent
that the judgments of the House of Lords were to be given solely
by the law lords. On that occasion there was a difference of
opinion among the law lords themselves. The judgment of the
majority of the House was strongly against the political feeling
of the government and of the peers as a body, while the law lords
who carried the decision had been appointed by previous governments
opposed in politics to the existing cabinet. But all these
temptations to a party vote by the unprofessional members were
resisted.</p>

<p>By § 20 of the act of 1873, the appellate jurisdiction of the
House of Lords (so far as it affects England) was abolished, but
this section was repealed by the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876.
Under that act and an amending act of 1887, the appellate
business of the House of Lords is conducted solely by the law
lords, though lay peers may still sit (<i>Bradlaugh</i> v. <i>Clarke</i>, 1882,
8 App. Cas. 354). No appeal may be heard or determined
except in the presence of not less than three of the following
persons:&mdash;(1) the lord chancellor; (2) the lords of appeal, four
of whom are appointed under the act from among persons who
hold, or have held, high judicial office, or, at the date of appointment,
have been in practice for not less than fifteen years as
barristers in England or Ireland, or as advocates in Scotland;
(3) such peers of parliament as hold, or have held, high judicial
office. By &ldquo;high judicial office&rdquo; is meant the office of lord
chancellor of Great Britain or Ireland, lord of appeal in ordinary,
paid judge of the judicial committee or member of that committee,
or judge of one of the superior courts of Great Britain
or Ireland.</p>

<p>An appeal lies to the House of Lords (1) from any order or
judgment of the court of appeal in England except as above
stated; (2) from a judgment or order of any court in Scotland
or Ireland from which error or an appeal to the House of Lords
lay by common law or statute immediately before the 1st of
November 1876. No appeals are heard from the decision of
courts in criminal cases. The House of Lords has an indirect
power by standing orders to admit appeals from Scotland or
Ireland which under former law or practice could not be admitted
(Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876, § 12). The procedure on
appeals is regulated by standing orders of the House. The
proceedings are commenced by petition of appeal, which must
be lodged with the clerk of the parliaments within one year from
the date of the last judgment it appealed from. Security for
costs (£200) must be given by bond or lodgment of the money,
unless dispensed with by the House on the ground of poverty
(act of 1893). Each party lodges a printed case signed and
certified by counsel, containing a resumé of the matters to be
discussed and of the contentions for or against the allowance of
the appeal. The hearing is before three or more law lords, who may
call in nautical assessors in admiralty cases (acts of 1893 and 1894).
It is not public in the full sense of the term, as persons not concerned
in the appeal can attend only by consent of the House.
The House pronounces the judgment which in the opinion of the
majority of the law lords should have been pronounced below,
and has jurisdiction in the case of all appeals to give or refuse
costs to the successful party. The costs of the appeal if given
are taxed by the officers of the House. The jurisdiction as to
costs does not directly arise under any statute (see <i>West Ham
Guardians</i> v. <i>Bethnal Green Churchwardens</i>, 1896, A.C. 477).</p>

<p><i>Appeals to the King in Council.</i>&mdash;The decisions of ecclesiastical
courts when acting within the limits of their jurisdiction, and
the decisions of courts in the king&rsquo;s dominions outside the
United Kingdom, and of courts in foreign countries set up under
the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts, cannot be dealt with by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
House of Lords or any of the ordinary tribunals of any part of
the United Kingdom. The power once claimed by the court
of king&rsquo;s bench in England to control the courts of Ireland has
lapsed, and its power to intervene in colonial cases is limited
to the grant of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> to a possession in which
no court exists having power to issue that writ or one of like
effect (Habeas Corpus Act 1862). As regards all British possessions,
the appeal to the king in council is in its origin and nature
like that of the provincials unto Caesar, and flows from the
royal prerogative to admit appeals. With the growth of the
British empire it has been found necessary to create a comparatively
constant and stable tribunal to advise the king in
the exercise of this prerogative. For this purpose the judicial
committee of the privy council was created in 1833. In 1851,
and again in 1870, it was reorganized, and by acts of 1876,
1887 and 1898 it received its present form. The committee
consists of the president of the council, and of the following
persons, if privy councillors&mdash;the lord chancellor and ex-chancellors
of Great Britain and of Ireland, the four lords of
appeal in ordinary, the lords justices of appeal in England or
retired lords justices of appeal in England, and persons who
hold or have held the office (<i>a</i>) of judge of the High Court of
Justice or the court of appeal in England or Ireland, or of the
court of session in Scotland; (<i>b</i>) any person who is or has been
chief justice or a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada or of a
superior court of any province of Canada, of any of the Australian
states (except Fiji and Papua), or of New Zealand or the Cape
of Good Hope or Natal. The number of persons of this class
who may be members at once is limited to five (1895, c. 44);
(<i>c</i>) provision is also made for the payment of two privy councillors
who have been judges in India who attend the privy council.</p>

<p>Numerous as are the members of the committee, the quorum
is three. One or more of the lords of appeal in ordinary usually
attend at every hearing, but the composition of the committee
is very fluctuating. Appeals from the British dominions abroad
lie in criminal as well as civil matters. The right of appeal is
regulated as to most possessions by order in council, and in some
cases is limited by imperial or colonial statute. Appeals are on
fact as well as on law, but the committee rarely if ever disturbs
the concurrent judgments on facts of two colonial courts. In
the case of admiralty appeals from colonial or consular courts,
naval assessors may be called in. The committee also hears
(with the aid of ecclesiastical assessors) appeals from ecclesiastical
courts. The judgment of the committee is in the form of a
report and advice to the king, which is read by one of the members
sitting, and no indication is given as to whether the members
present are unanimous. Effect is given to the advice by orders
in council dismissing or allowing the appeal, and giving direction
as to the payment of costs and as to the further proceedings to
be taken in the colonial courts.</p>

<p>The procedure of the committee is on the same lines as that on
appeals to the House of Lords; no well-arranged code of practice
existed however up to the end of 1908, and new rules were
then being proposed on the subject. The appeal is commenced
by a petition of appeal, and by the giving of security for costs. In
colonial appeals printed cases are lodged containing a summary
of the contentions of the parties, and with this a printed copy of
the record of the proceedings and documents used in the courts
appealed from. The hearing is in the privy council chamber
and is not public. When an appeal is called on, the counsel and
parties are summoned into the chamber, and when the arguments
are concluded they are requested to retire. The appeals to the
king in council from colonial states having a federal constitution,
like Canada and Australia, stand in an exceptional position.
The act creating the Supreme Court of Canada purports to make
the decision of that court final. But it is still the practice to
admit by special leave a prerogative appeal from the court, and
to entertain appeals from courts of the provinces of Canada
direct to the king in council, without requiring them to go to
the Supreme Court. The constitution of the Australian Commonwealth
contemplates (§ 73) the possibility of restricting appeals
to the king in council from the supreme courts of Australia,
and sec. 74 forbids appeals to the king in council except by
leave of the High Court of Australia from decision of that court
on any question however arising as to the limits <i>inter se</i> of the
constitutional powers of the commonwealth and those of any
state or states, or as to the limits <i>inter se</i> of the constitutional
powers of any two or more states. The exact effect of these
enactments and of Australian legislation under § 73 is a matter
of controversy.</p>

<p><i>Scotland.</i>&mdash;In Scotland the ordinary appellate tribunal for
decisions of inferior courts and of the lords ordinary is the court
of session, which for appellate purposes sits in two divisions.
Appeals from inferior tribunals in criminal cases go before the
judges of the court of session sitting in the High Court of
Justiciary. The court of session was in its original constitution
a committee of parliament for the performance of its judicial
functions, and an appeal to parliament was consequently
anomalous. In the reign of Charles II., however, the courts
grew so intolerably corrupt that a determined effort was made
to have their judgments overturned, by an appeal which was
strictly of the old character of a cry for protection against
flagrant injustice. It was called a &ldquo;protest for remeid of law,&rdquo;
and was inserted as one of the national claims in the Petition of
Right at the revolution. The treaty of union is silent as to
appeals, though definitely excluding the right of English courts
to interfere with Scottish courts or cases. The House of Lords
has since the Union acted without challenge as the final appellate
tribunal for Scotland in civil causes; but has always declined
jurisdiction in Scottish criminal cases.</p>

<p><i>Ireland.</i>&mdash;The Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland) Acts
have remodelled the courts and appellate system of Ireland on
the same lines as those of England. The High Court of Justice
in Ireland now consists of two divisions only, the chancery
division, which has little or no appellate functions, and the
king&rsquo;s bench division, which has for Ireland substantially the
same power of reviewing and correcting the decisions of inferior
courts as has the corresponding court in England. To this there
is one exception, that appeals from a county court in Ireland
may be heard on circuit by a single judge of assize. In Ireland
there is also a court of appeal, created in 1877, whose jurisdiction
and procedure follow the same lines as that of the English court
of appeal.</p>

<p><i>France.</i>&mdash;The court of last resort in France for all cases,
whether civil or criminal (<i>en matière criminelle, correctionnelle
et de police</i>), is the <i>cour de cassation</i>, which sits in Paris. It is a
court of error for the review of all judgments of tribunals of last
resort (except <i>juges de paix</i> in certain cases), and for the transfer
of causes from one court to another when justice so demands,
and to determine conflicts of jurisdiction (Law 1 Dec. 1790).
Ordinarily it is confined to errors of law and procedure, but
where evidence not available below is brought before the court, it
may send the case back for retrial or give the appropriate final
judgment, as in the case of Dreyfus (1906). It also hears appeals
from courts martial.</p>

<p>Next to the <i>cour de cassation</i> are the courts of appeal, which
have jurisdiction to hear appeals (1) in civil matters from courts
of first instance, <i>juges de paix</i>, and where the amount in dispute
exceeds £60 from commercial courts, <i>tribunaux de commerce</i>
(Civil Proc. Code, arts. 443-475); (2) in criminal matters from
<i>tribunaux correctionnels</i> (Com. Proc. Code, arts. 202-235). The
appeal is both on fact and on law, and applies to interlocutory or
preparatory as well as to final judgments.</p>

<p><i>Spain.</i>&mdash;In Spain the jurisdiction and procedure with reference
to appeals is on the same lines as in France. As regards civil
matters it is regulated by title 21 of the Civil Procedure Code.
The appeal to the supreme court is for the most part on questions
of law (<i>por infraccion de ley o de doctrina</i>); but the court has
also power to review judgments on materials not available at
the first hearing (arts. 1796, 1801).</p>

<p><i>British India.</i>&mdash;In British India complete and systematic
provision is made for appeals both in civil and in criminal cases
by the Procedure Codes (Civil of 1882, with subsequent amendments,
and Criminal of 1898), and also to some extent by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>216</span>
charters of the high courts of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras
(see Ilbert, <i>Government of India</i>, Oxford, 1898, p. 137). In
addition, the decisions of subordinate tribunals may be revised
by a superior tribunal <i>proprio motu</i>, or reviewed in a proper case
by the tribunal which has given them; and provision is made
for the consultation of a superior by an inferior tribunal in cases
of legal difficulty. The policy of admitting so many appeals
has been criticized. But with an enormous population which
has no representative institutions it has been deemed wise to
provide ample means of correcting judicial errors at the instance
not only of the aggrieved person but also at the instance of the
supervising judicial authorities, as a means of ensuring regularity
and propriety in the conduct of judicial business by subordinate
judges in out-of-the-way districts.</p>

<p><i>Civil Appeals.</i>&mdash;(1) Except where otherwise expressly provided
by the Civil Procedure Code, or by any other law for the
time being in force, an appeal lies from the whole or part of any
decree, whether made <i>ex parte</i> or <i>inter partes</i>, of a court exercising
original jurisdiction (Civil Procedure Code, § 540). By
&ldquo;decree&rdquo; is meant the final expression of an adjudication upon
a right claimed or defence set up in a civil court, when such
adjudication, so far as regards the court expressing it, decides
the suit (§ 2). The appeal is both on facts and on law. The
procedure on the appeal is prescribed by c. 41 of the Civil
Procedure Code, and the directions of the code deal even with
the language of the judgment on appeal and the matters to be
stated therein. (2) Decrees passed on an appeal to any court in
India subordinate to a High Court are as a general rule subject
to appeal to the High Court on the grounds (<i>a</i>) that they are
contrary to a specified law, or usage having the force of law;
(<i>b</i>) that they have failed to determine some material issue of law,
or usage having the force of law; (<i>c</i>) of substantial error or defect
in procedure prescribed by the code or other law which might
possibly have produced error or defect in the decision of the case
upon the merits (§ 584). The procedure on these appeals is
regulated by c. 42 of the Civil Procedure Code. (3) Appeals from
orders which do not fall within the definition of decrees are
allowed in the cases specified in § 588 of the code. The procedure
with respect to these appeals is on the same lines as that on
appeals against decrees (§ 590). Provision is made (by c. 44)
for allowing appeals <i>in forma pauperis</i> after certain preliminary
inquiries. In the High Courts appeals lie from the decision of
one judge to two or more judges of the High Court, whose decision
has effect as a judgment of the full court. Appeals, in civil
cases, from the courts of India to the king in council are
regulated by c. 45 of the Civil Procedure Code. The appealable
amount is for most cases Rs. 10,000 or a claim or question as
to property of like amount.</p>

<p>Besides the provisions stated as to appeals, Indian courts
have power in certain contingencies to review their own decisions
(§ 623). An inferior court may also refer cases of difficulty to the
High Court on a statement of the facts as found in the referring
court and of the opinion thereon of that Court (§§ 617-620);
and in cases in which no appeal lies to the High Court, that court
may call for the record of any case in which the court below
appears to have acted without jurisdiction or failed to exercise
its jurisdiction, or to have exercised its jurisdiction illegally or
with material illegality (§ 622).</p>

<p><i>Criminal Matters.</i>&mdash;Criminal jurisdiction in India is exercised
by magistrates of the first, second and third class, by sessions
courts, and the high or chief courts of the presidencies or
provinces (Criminal Procedure Code of 1898). The higher judges
in a district have the power of revising those decisions which
are not absolutely summary of the judges of the classes below
them in the same district; <i>i.e.</i> the sessions judge can revise the
decisions of a first-class magistrate, and the High Court those
of a sessions judge (§ 435). Inferior tribunals can also refer
questions of law to the High Court (§§ 432, 433); and where a
sentence of death is passed, or a sessions judge differs from the
jury (§ 307), the matter must be referred to the High Court.
On matters of reference or revision the parties have no right to
be heard.</p>

<p>Provision is also made for appeals by c. 31 of the Code.
Appeals from second- or third-class magistrates are dealt with
by the district (first-class) magistrate (§ 407). Persons convicted
on trial by assistant sessions judges or first-class magistrates,
except in cases where the punishment is very small, have
an appeal to the sessions judge (§§ 408, 413). A person convicted
on trial by the sessions judge has an appeal to the High Court
(§ 410), but where he has pleaded guilty the only point on which
appeal is open is the legality or extent of sentence (§ 412).
Special provision is made as to appeals by persons born in
Europe (whether British subjects or not) and Americans (§§ 408,
415, and c. 33).</p>

<p>In criminal cases there is a right of appeal to the king in
council in certain cases provided for by the charters of the
chartered high courts (see Ilbert, <i>Government of India</i>, Oxford,
1898, p. 137).</p>

<p>An appeal also lies in certain cases from the courts of British
officers in feudatory states of India to a high court in India,
and from the courts of Aden and Zanzibar and British East Africa
to the High Court of Bombay. Appeals do not lie from the courts
of native states to British courts in India, though in some cases
there is an appeal of a political rather than judicial nature from
the judicial tribunals of feudatory states; <i>e.g.</i> in the case of
Kathiawar (<i>Hemchand Derchand</i> v. <i>Azam Sakarlal</i>; 1906. L.R.
A.C. 212).</p>

<p><i>Canada.</i>&mdash;In Canada each province has the regulation of its
own courts of justice. In Ontario the judiciary are organized,
under the Provincial Judicature Acts, in much the same manner
as in England; and the review of decisions of inferior courts (by
appeal or other proceedings based on English practice) is in the
hands of the High Court of Justice, subject to appeal to the
provincial court of appeal. In Quebec the highest court (king&rsquo;s
bench), besides its original jurisdiction, has appellate jurisdiction
over the superior court (see Quebec Civil Procedure Code, art.
1114 <i>et seq</i>.). The jurisdiction is exercised by writ of error or
by appeal, according to the nature of the decision appealed from.
The judges of the superior court have also, under art. 494, power
to review before three judges decisions of a judge of that court
or of a circuit court (arts. 494-504). Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Manitoba and British Columbia have supreme courts
with appellate authority over decisions of single judges of the
court and over inferior tribunals in the province. Appeals lie
from the highest courts of each province, in civil matters, to the
Supreme Court of Canada, or to the king in council in cases
falling within the orders in council applying to each province,
but in criminal matters to the king in council. From the
Supreme Court of Canada no appeal lies as of right to the king
in council (Dominion Act 1875, 38 Vic. c. 11, § 47), and the royal
prerogative of granting special leave to appeal is sparingly exercised.
The principles on which the judicial committee acts in
advising for or against the grant of special leave in civil case&amp;
are stated in <i>Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co.</i> v. <i>M&lsquo;Laughlin</i>,
1904, L.R. A.C. 776. It is, however, as before, quite common
for appeals to be brought direct to the privy council from
the provincial courts without resort to the Dominion court (see
Wheeler, <i>Privy Council Law</i>, p. 955).</p>

<p><i>Australia.</i>&mdash;Each of the states of the Australian Commonwealth
has its own supreme court. The Commonwealth parliament
constituted in 1903 a High Court for Australia, which,
besides its original federal jurisdiction, is also a court of appeal
from the supreme courts of the constitutional states, or from any
state court from which an appeal lay to the king in council at
the establishment of the Commonwealth. The jurisdiction of the
court is defined by the Judiciary Act of 1903, by which it is
created. The right of appeal is given both as to criminal and
civil matters.</p>

<p><i>South Africa.</i>&mdash;In Cape Colony and Natal the appellate courts
are the supreme courts, subject to further appeal in certain cases
to the king in council. The superior courts of Cape Colony are
empowered to review the proceedings of all inferior courts in
the colony and its dependencies in cases where no appeal lies.
There was for a time an appeal from the High Court of Orange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span>
River Colony to the supreme court of the Transvaal, and from
that court (whether acting for its own colony or on appeal from
the Orange Colony), an appeal to the king in council. In other
colonies the provisions as to appeal follow more or less closely
the lines of English law and procedure as to appeals, and in all
cases the ultimate appeal is to the king in council.</p>

<p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;In the American courts the term &ldquo;appeal&rdquo;
covers (1) a removal of a cause to a higher court for retrial on
all the questions of law or fact involved, or (2) taking up points
of law only by proceedings in error, for revision by a higher court.
Decrees in admiralty, bankruptcy and equity, in the federal
courts, are the subjects of an appeal; judgments in actions at
law, of a writ of error. On an equity appeal the evidence taken
at the original hearing is reported at length to the appellate court,
and it has the right to review the conclusions of fact reached by
the court below and come to different ones. This, however, is
seldom done, the appeal being almost always decided on points of
law based upon the conclusions of fact reached in the original
hearing. In admiralty appeals the conclusions of fact reached by
the trial court are specially set forth, and are final.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Appeal&rdquo; in many of the states is the general term for
reviewing any judgment of an inferior court on assignments of
error. It is also often used to signify a mode of reviewing proceedings
of municipal bodies, affecting the interests of particular
persons, <i>e.g.</i> in matters of licences or assessments.</p>

<p>In criminal prosecutions an appeal, or writ of error on points
of law, is almost everywhere allowed by statute to the defendant,
and often to the state. (<i>United States</i> v. <i>Sanges</i>, 144 United
States Reports, 310; <i>State</i> v. <i>Lee</i>, 65 Connecticut Reports, 265.)</p>

<p>By the constitution of the United States the Supreme Court
is vested with &ldquo;appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact,
with such exceptions, and under such regulations, as the Congress
shall make.&rdquo; This provision is held not to create but only to
authorize the creation of the jurisdiction. In the words of
Chancellor Kent, &ldquo;If congress had not provided any rule to
regulate the proceedings in appeal, the court could not exercise
an appellate jurisdiction: and, if a rule be provided, the court
could not depart from it.&rdquo; In pursuance of this principle, the
Supreme Court decided in <i>Clarke</i> v. <i>Bazadone</i> that a writ of error
did not lie to that court from a court of the United States territory
north-west of the Ohio, because the act had not authorized an
appeal or writ of error from such a court (<i>Commentaries</i>, i. 324).
The appellate jurisdiction of the court is now regulated by title
13 chap. ii. of the Revised Statutes of the United States (1873),
§§ 690-710; and by the acts enumerated at p. 901 of the Revised
Statutes, United States, 1873 to 1891. Under these statutes the
Supreme Court may entertain appeals from the highest court of a
state of the Union, but only (1) where the state court has decided
against the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States,
or of an authority exercised under the United States; (2) where
a state court has affirmed the validity of a statute, or of an
authority exercised which has been challenged on the ground of
repugnance to the constitution, laws or treaties of the United
States; (3) where the state court has decided against the
existence of a title, right, privilege, or immunity claimed or set
up under the constitution of, or under any statute, treaty,
commission or authority of the United States.</p>

<p>The appeal from state courts is by writ of error, <i>i.e.</i> on law
only; and applies as well in criminal as in civil cases. The
Supreme Court will not act unless the federal question was
raised in the court below (<i>Chicago U.S. Mail Co.</i> v. <i>McGuire</i>,
1904, 196, U.S. 128). The circuit court of appeals, established
in 1891, deals with appeals from the district and circuit courts of
the United States, except where other provision is made, <i>e.g.</i>
where the jurisdiction of the court appealed from is in question;
in prize causes and convictions of capital crimes (U.S. Statutes,
1801, c. 54. § 5); in cases involving the construction or application
of the constitution; in cases arising in district or circuit courts
involving the constitutional questions already stated as subject
of appeal from state courts.</p>

<p>The review by the circuit court of appeals is effected by
appeal or by writ of error, and its decision is final, with certain
exceptions but with power to certify cases to the Supreme Court
for instructions (1891, c. 511, § 6).</p>

<p>The Supreme Court hears appeals from the circuit court
of appeals within the limits above stated, and appeals from
the circuit and district courts in cases in which an appeal
does not lie to the circuit court of appeals, and has power
to issue a <i>certiorari</i> to transfer a case from the circuit court of
Appeals.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APPEARANCE<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>apparere</i>, to appear), in law, the
coming into court of either of the parties to a suit; the formal
act by which a defendant submits himself to the jurisdiction of
the court. The defendant in an action in the High Court of
England enters his appearance to the writ of summons by
delivering, either at the central office of the Supreme Court, or
a district registry, a written memorandum either giving his
solicitor&rsquo;s name or stating that he defends in person. He must
also give notice to the plaintiff of his appearance, which ought,
according to the time limited by the writ, to be within eight
days after service; a defendant may, however, appear any time
before judgment. The <i>Rules of the Supreme Court</i>, orders xii.
and xiii., regulate the procedure with respect to the entering of
an appearance, the giving of notice, the limit of time, the setting
aside and the general effect of default of appearance. In
county courts there is no appearance other than the coming
into court of the parties to the suit. In criminal cases the
accused appears in person. In civil cases infants appear by
their guardians <i>ad litem</i>; lunatics by their committee; companies
by a solicitor; friendly societies by the trustee or other
officer appointed to sue or be sued on behalf thereof.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APPENDICITIS,<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> the modern medical term for inflammation
of that part of the intestine which is known as the &ldquo;appendix.&rdquo;
Though not a new disease, there can be no doubt that it is far
commoner than it used to be, though the explanation of this
increased frequency is not yet forthcoming. Amongst the
virulent micro-organisms associated with the disease no one
specific germ has hitherto been found. It may be remarked that
the theories that influenza, or the use of preserved foods, may
be connected with the disease as cause and effect, have supporters.
Sometimes the disease is due to the impaction of a pin, shot-corn,
tooth-brush bristle, or fish-bone in the appendix, which has set
up inflammation and ulceration. In many cases a patch of
mortification with perforation of the appendix is caused by the
presence of a hard faecal concretion, or &ldquo;stercolith,&rdquo; which from
its size, shape and appearance has been mistaken by a casual
observer for a date-stone or cherry-stone.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact of the more frequent occurrence of
appendicitis, the disease is now better understood and more
promptly recognized. It was formerly included under the term
&ldquo;perityphlitis&rdquo;&mdash;that is, inflammation connected with the
caecum or <i>blind</i> portion of the large intestine. But in the vast
majority of cases the inflammation begins in the appendix, not
in the intestine proper. It is apt to extend and set up a localized
peritonitis, which in the worst cases may become general.</p>

<p>Appendicitis is more often met with in the young than the old,
and in boys rather than girls; and in some families there is a
strange predisposition towards it. It is often started by a chill,
or by over-exertion, and sometimes the attack follows a blow or
strain, or some other direct injury, after which the virulent
micro-organisms seize on the mucous membrane and involve the
appendix in acute inflammation.</p>

<p>The appendix is a narrow tube, about the size of a goose-quill,
with an average length of 3 in. It terminates in a blunt point,
and from its worm-like shape is called <i>vermiformis</i>. It is an
appendage of the large intestine, into which it opens, and is
regarded as the degenerate relic, surviving in man and other
mammals, of an earlier form of intestine. Foreign bodies passing
down the intestinal canal may find their way into the appendix
and lodge there. Frequently the diseased appendix is found
blocked by hard faeces or undigested particles of food, such as
nuts, fibrous vegetable matter, and other imperfectly masticated
substances; inflammation may occur, however, without the
presence of any impacted material. The appendix may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span>
twisted, bent, or otherwise strangulated, or its orifice may be
blocked, so that the tube is distended with mucus which can find
no outlet; or ulceration of tuberculous or malignant origin
may occur. Inflammation started in the appendix is liable to
spread to the peritoneum, and herein lies the gravity of the
affection and the indication for treatment. The symptoms vary
from &ldquo;indigestion,&rdquo; and slight pain and sickness, which pass off
in a few short days, to an exceedingly violent illness, which may
cause death in a few hours. Pain is usually first felt in the
belly, low down on the right side or across the region of the
navel; sometimes, however, it is diffuse, and at other times it is
scarcely complained of. There is some fever, the temperature
rising to 101° or 102° F., with nausea, and very likely with
vomiting. The abdomen is tender to pressure, and the tenderness
may be referred to the spot mentioned above. Some swelling
may also be made out in that region. The attack may last for
two, three or four days, and then subside. There are, however,
other cases less well defined, in which the mischief pursues a
latent course, producing little more than a vague abdominal
uneasiness, until it suddenly advances into a violent stage. In
some chronic cases the trouble continues, on and off, for months
or even for years.</p>

<p>On paper it is easy to arrange cases of appendicitis into three
classes&mdash;catarrhal, ulcerative and mortifying&mdash;but in actual
practice this is neither desirable
nor possible. Such classification
is based upon the symptoms, and
in appendicitis symptoms may be
actually misleading. The three
conditions to which the surgeon
chiefly looks for guidance are
the aspect of the patient, the
rate of his pulse and the degree
of fever as shown by the thermometer.
But in certain cases
of appendicitis, though the surgeon
knows intuitively, or, at
least, suspects, that the general
condition is extremely serious,
the patient looks fairly well and
says that he is not in pain, his
pulse-rate being but little quickened
and his temperature being
but slightly above normal.
Nevertheless, when the surgeon
has opened the belly in the appendix region, he finds the
appendix swollen, perforated and mortified, and lying in a
stinking abscess, whilst inflammation has already spread to
the neighbouring coils of intestine. Unfortunately, the surgeon
can no more tell what he is going to find at his operation in
some of these cases than he can foretell the course which any
particular case is going to run.</p>

<p>We may most usefully give here the symptoms as they are
likely to be found in an ordinary case of appendicitis, and
as they may be observed by one who is not a member of the
medical profession, in a way that may prove helpful to him when
circumstances have awakened his interest in the disease.</p>

<p>The case taken shall be that of a boy at school, for, as already
stated, boys are more prone to the disease than girls. The boy
has had, may be, occasional attacks of &ldquo;indigestion&rdquo; which
have duly passed away under the influence of aperient medicines,
and, being heated at play, he has sat down upon the cold ground.
Or he has got wet through or over-tired during a long walk or
ride. At any rate, his vital powers have been suddenly lowered,
and the micro-organisms teeming in his bowel have seized upon
the lining membrane of the appendix. He feels out of sorts, and
if he manages to eat a meal he very likely vomits it soon after,
for the whole nervous system of his abdomen is disturbed by
the local inflammation. The act of vomiting gives slight relief,
however, and probably he begins to complain of pains in his
head as well as in his abdomen, and possibly he has an attack of
shivering&mdash;the result of disturbance of his general nervous
system. By this time he may be attacked with intense pain in
the part of his abdomen a little above the middle of the right
groin, and at that spot there may be a tenderness, and a feeling
of resistance may be made out by the gentle pressure of the
finger. In order to relax the pressure upon the tender area he
probably lies with his right thigh slightly bent. By this time
he may look ill, his face being slightly flushed, or pale and anxious.
If the clinical thermometer is placed under his tongue, the index
may rise a degree or two, perhaps several degrees, above normal,
and his pulse may be quickened to 90 or 100 beats a minute.
Perhaps it is a good deal quicker than this. Later, the skin of
the lower part of the right side of the abdomen may be flushed
or reddened.</p>

<p>This clinical picture leaves no room for doubt. The boy has
an attack of acute septic inflammation of his appendix. Let it
be that the symptoms have come on quickly, and that the
affection is not more than ten or twelve hours old; no one can
tell precisely what course the disease is going to run. It may be
that with rest in bed, constant fomentations, and absolute
starvation, the inflammation will subside; but it is just as
likely that in spite of this judicious treatment the symptoms
will go from bad to worse, and that a belated operation will fail
to rescue the boy from a general peritonitis which may end
fatally. But at present, so far as one can tell, the disease is still
limited to the appendix. And what, at this moment, is the best
line of treatment? Some practitioners would answer&mdash;&ldquo;Let
the acute attack settle down, and then, after a week or ten days,
when everything is quiet, remove the appendix, for statistics
show that when the operation is done in the quiet interval the
results are extremely favourable, whilst if it is done in the acute
stage the outlook is not so bright.&rdquo; This is quite right. But
one cannot be sure that the &ldquo;quiet interval&rdquo; will ever arrive.
The case in question may be one of those which rapidly go on
from bad to worse, and mortification and perforation of the
appendix having taken place over some hard faecal concretion,
general peritonitis is inevitable, with distension of the bowel and
hopeless blood-poisoning. If it were certain that the attack of
appendicitis would subside and become quiescent, it would be
wise to wait. But it too often happens that the first attack is,
indeed, the last. Acute appendicitis is one thing; relapsing
appendicitis is another. The latter condition is very manageable.</p>

<p>Inasmuch, then, as it is impossible to know what direction
the disease will take, whether to quiescence or to disaster, it is
for the greatest good in the greatest number of cases that the
inflamed appendix be removed by operation whilst the disease
is still limited to the appendix. It is highly probable that if
every available hospital surgeon were asked if he had ever had
cause to regret having advised early operation in a case of
appendicitis the answer would be &ldquo;No&rdquo;; on the other hand,
every surgeon would be able to recall cases in which delay had
been followed by disaster&mdash;which an early resort to operation
would, in all probability, have prevented.</p>

<p>If the disease is going to assume the severe form, all the
symptoms, as a rule, increase in severity. The facial expression
becomes more anxious, and the accumulation of gas in the
paralysed intestine causes an increase in the abdominal distension,
so that the patient lies with his knees drawn up. The
vomiting continues. The pulse quickens to 120 or 140 a minute,
and the temperature rises, perhaps to 104° F. The swelling and
tenderness increase on the right side of the abdomen, and if the
abscess does not find escape externally it probably bursts into
the general peritoneal cavity, and the patient becomes bathed
in profuse sweat, the result of blood-poisoning. Death is likely
to follow within two days, the result of blood-poisoning and
exhaustion.</p>

<p><i>Catarrhal and Relapsing Appendicitis.</i>&mdash;Some cases of appendicitis
run a mild course, giving rise to no worse symptoms, perhaps,
than those of &ldquo;indigestion&rdquo; and nausea, with a feeling of general
discomfort in the abdomen, and, probably, some local tenderness.
The attack may be preceded or accompanied by constipation.
The administration of a mild aperient or an enema, rest,
starvation and fomentation will probably put matters right
again&mdash;at any rate for a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span></p>

<p>This form of the disease may be due to the presence of
&ldquo;bolted,&rdquo; unchewed or indigestible food in that part of the
large intestine into which the appendix opens. And these mild
recurrent attacks may sometimes be got rid of altogether by
having the teeth put in order, and by inducing the individual
to choose his food with discretion, to chew it carefully, to take
his meals regularly and to eat slowly.</p>

<p>Obviously, these attacks are very different from those of
the acute septic form of the disease described above, though
there is no telling that one of them may not develop into the
acute form. Some of the mild attacks are due to a kink in the
appendix, or to some other condition which temporarily prevents
the secretions of the appendix from finding their way into the
large intestine. Others of them are caused by a passing catarrhal
inflammation of the lining of the appendix and have a distant
resemblance to a recurring &ldquo;sore throat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After undergoing one or two of these mild attacks the patient
would be well advised to have his appendix removed when it has
once more got into the &ldquo;quiet stage.&rdquo; Experience abundantly
shows that the operation can then be performed with but slight
disturbance of the patient, and with the smallest possible amount
of risk. And until his vulnerable appendix has been removed
he is never safe.</p>

<p>In the <i>chronic</i> form of the disease though the patient is never
desperately ill he is never quite well. He has pains and discomfort
in the abdomen, with slight tenderness and nausea,
with &ldquo;indigestion,&rdquo; as he may call it. And as one can never tell
when the smouldering inflammation may break out into conflagration,
he is well advised to submit himself to operation
without further delay. To carry about a diseased appendix is to
run the constant risk of being laid up at a time most inconvenient,
as when travelling or when staying in some place where skilled
assistance is far distant or absolutely unobtainable. But having
made up his mind that the appendix had better be removed,
the patient can choose time, place and surgeon, and, having
undergone a week&rsquo;s careful training for the ordeal, can safely
count on being back at work again in a month or six weeks&rsquo;
time.</p>

<p>As regards <i>treatment</i>, the greatest safety consists in the prompt
removal of the inflamed appendix, and statistics show that if the
operation can be done in the first or second day of even an acute
attack, the result is generally favourable&mdash;that is to say, if the
appendix can be removed whilst the disease is still shut up
within its tissues. But in some cases ulceration and perforation,
or mortification, may have taken place over a hard faecal
concretion within the first twenty-four or forty-eight hours,
and, the septic germs having been let loose, peritonitis may
have already set in, and operation may be followed by disappointment.
Still, if the case had been left unoperated on,
no other result could have been expected. It was not to the
operation, but to the intensely acute disease that the calamity
must be attributed.</p>

<p>Nature is marvellously clever in some of these cases in shutting
off the area of the disease by glueing together the neighbouring
coils of intestine, the limited local peritonitis causing the tissues
to build themselves into a wall which securely shuts in the
abscess cavity. But in other cases she seems helpless, no barrier
being formed for limiting the area of disturbance. In such a
case it is inevitable that disappointment must result from the
surgeon delaying operation in the hope that delimitation might
take place. And when at last he makes his incision he sees that
the disease has had so long a start that his own chance of success
is but a poor one. In a less severe attack, under the influence of
rest, starvation and fomentation, and in cases of chronic and of
relapsing disease, the surgeon may watch and wait and choose
his own time for operating. But when the symptoms are steadily
increasing in severity he should urge an immediate incision.
When, as often happens, the inflammation begins suddenly and
severely, and, under the influence of treatment, steadily quiets
down, the surgeon does well to delay operation. But in a fortnight
or so, when everything has become once more quiet, he
will urge the removal of the appendix, for this one attack is
more than likely to be the forerunner of other attacks if the
diseased appendix is left.</p>

<p>The most serious cases are those in which the aspect, the
pulse, and the temperature of the patient fail to give warning
of a very advanced state of disease. Every surgeon of experience
has met with cases in which, though there is nothing pointing
to the fact that the patient is on the brink of a disaster, the
operation has shown that the appendix is mortified, and that it
is surrounded with abundant foul matter. It is then that he
regrets not having operated a day or two earlier. Consequently
it is a good rule to operate in all doubtful cases. In cases in
which one happens to know that previous attacks have passed
off under palliative treatment, there is no need for immediate
operation; the quiet interval may be safely waited for. But
in cases in which there is &ldquo;no history,&rdquo; and in which the surgeon
has nothing to guide him, the greatest safety is in prompt
operation.</p>

<p>If an attack of acute appendicitis is allowed to take its course
unoperated on, abscess forms in the peritoneal cavity in the
region of the appendix, but if already inflammation has happily
glued the intestines together around that area, the pus is confined
within definite limits. But as the abscess increases in size the
demand for its evacuation becomes urgent. The pus, under the
influence of a natural law, seeks its escape by the path of least
resistance; sometimes this is into the intestine, and occasionally
into the bladder. The most satisfactory course which it can take
is through the wall of the abdomen and out above the right groin.
As it is making its way in this direction the skin over that part
becomes red, swollen, hot and tender, and the tissues between it
and the skin become swollen and brawny. Rarely is <i>fluctuation</i>
to be made out until the pus has worked its way close to the
surface. Later, ulceration takes place in the undermined skin,
and the stinking contents of the abscess escape, greatly to the
relief of the patient. But long before this could happen the
surgeon should have made an incision through the inflamed
tissues in order to give nature some greatly needed help. For
in many cases she allows the pus blindly to discover that the
course of least resistance is not towards the surface of the
abdomen but through the inflammatory barrier formed by the
adherent coils of bowel, and so into the general peritoneal cavity.
This unfortunate issue may give temporary relief to the patient,
so that he says that he feels much better, and that his pain has
nearly gone. But though his temperature may fall, his pulse is
apt to quicken&mdash;an ominous coupling of symptoms; the paralysed
bowels become further distended, so that the lungs are
pressed upon and breathing is embarrassed; hiccough comes on;
and whether operation is now resorted to or not, a fatal end is
highly probable. In other cases, the escaping pus finds its way
up towards the liver and forms an abscess below the base of the
lungs.</p>

<p>If operation is performed when appendicitis has run on to
the formation of abscess, and the diseased appendix presents
itself, it should of course be removed; but if it does not present
itself the surgeon should abstain from making a determined
search for it, as in so doing he may break down the barrier which
nature has provided, and thus himself become the means of
spreading a septic peritonitis. Nor should he attempt to make
clean the foul abscess cavity. All that he should do is to provide
for efficient drainage. A large proportion of these cases do
extremely well with incision and drainage, and in the subsequent
healing of the cavity the wreckage of the appendix either undergoes
disintegration or is rendered harmless for further anxiety.</p>

<p>In some cases, however, the damaged appendix remains as a
smouldering ember, ready at any moment to cause further conflagration.
This is made manifest by lingering pains, and by
tenderness and warnings after the abscess has healed, and the
patient will be well advised to have what is left of the appendix
removed by operation at a time of quiescence. The operation,
however, may turn out to be a very difficult one. Sometimes
the wound by which the abscess has been evacuated, by nature
or by art, refuses to heal completely, a little discharge of a faecal
odour continuing to escape. The small wound leads into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
faecal fistula, and a bent probe passed along it would probably
find its way into the bowel. The wound is likely to close of itself
in due course; but if after many weeks of disappointment it
still continues to discharge, the surgeon may advise an operation
for its obliteration.</p>

<p>It occasionally happens that after operation the scar of the
wound in the abdominal wall yields under the pressure from
within, and a bulging of the intestines beneath the skin occurs.
This is called a <i>ventral hernia</i>, and if the patient cannot be made
comfortable by wearing a truss with a large flat pad, an operation
may be deemed advisable.</p>

<p>If, in a case of appendicitis, for one reason or another operation
is to be delayed, what treatment should be resorted to? The
patient should be put to bed with his knees resting over a pillow,
and a large fomentation under oil silk should be laid over the
lower part of the abdomen. No food should be given beyond
an occasional sip of hot water. Purgatives should not be
administered, as this would be to set in movement an inflamed
piece of bowel. If the case is not acute, a large enema of soap
and water with turpentine may be given, or, possibly, a dose of
castor oil by the mouth. As a rule, however, it is unwise to set
the bowels in vigorous action until the diseased appendix has
been removed. No opium should be given.</p>

<p>Acute intestinal obstruction, cancer of the intestine, inflammation
of the ovary, typhoid fever and renal and gallstone
colic, are affections which are apt to be mistaken for appendicitis.
The first of these resembles it most closely, and diagnosis is
sometimes impossible without resort to operation. And it is a
fortunate thing that, when error of diagnosis has been made,
the operation which was designed for dealing with an inflamed
appendix may be directed with equal advantage to the morbid
condition which is found on opening the abdomen. In typhoid
fever the characteristic temperature, the general condition of
the patient, and the presence of delirium are differentiating
signs of importance; in renal and gallstone colic the situation
and the more paroxysmal character of the pain are usually
distinctive.</p>

the 4th of November 1768. Educated at Rome, he took orders

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APPENZELL,<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> one of the cantons of north-east Switzerland,
entirely surrounded by the canton of St Gall; both were formed
out of the dominions of the prince abbots of St Gall, whence the
name Appenzell (<i>abbatis cello</i>). It is an alpine region, particularly
in its south portion, where rises the Alpstein limestone
range (culminating in the Säntis, 8216 ft.), though towards the
north the surface is composed rather of green hills, separating
green hollows in which nestle neat villages and small towns.
It is mainly watered by two streams that descend from the
Säntis, the Urnasch joining the Sitter (on which is the capital,
Appenzell), which later flows into the Thur. There are light
railways from Appenzell to St Gall either (12½ m.) past Gais or
(20½ m.) past Herisau, as well as lines from St Gall to Trogen
(6 m.) and from Rorschach to Heiden (4¼ m.). Since 1597 it has
been divided, for religious reasons, into two half-cantons, which
are quite independent of each other, and differ in many points.</p>

<p>The north and west portion or <i>Ausser Rhoden</i> has a total area
of 93.6 sq. m. (of which 90.6 are classed as &ldquo;productive&rdquo;;
forests covering 22·5 sq. m. and glaciers .038 sq. m.), with a
population (in 1900) of 55,281, mainly German-speaking, and
containing 49,797 Protestants as against 5418 Romanists. Its
political capital is Trogen (<i>q.v.</i>), though the largest town is
Herisau (<i>q.v.</i>), while Teufen has 4595 inhabitants, and Heiden
(3745 inhabitants) in the north-east corner is the most frequented
of the many goats&rsquo; whey cure resorts for which the entire canton
is famous (Urnäsch and Gais are also in Ausser Rhoden). This
half-canton is divided into three administrative districts,
comprising twenty communes, and is mainly industrial, the manufacture
of cotton goods, muslins, and embroidery being very
flourishing. It sends one member (elected by the <i>Landsgemeinde</i>)
to the federal <i>Ständerath</i> and three to the federal <i>Nationalrath</i>
(elected by a direct popular vote).</p>

<p>The south or more mountainous portion of Appenzell forms
the half-canton of Appenzell, <i>Inner Rhoden</i>. It has a total area
of 66.7 sq. m. (of which 62.8 sq. m. are classed as &ldquo;productive,&rdquo;
forests covering 12.8 sq. m. and glaciers .38 sq. m.), and a total
population of 13,499, practically all German-speaking, and all but
833 Romanists. Its political capital is Appenzell (<i>q.v.</i>), which is
also the largest village, while Weissbad (near it) and Gonten are
the best-known goats&rsquo; whey cure resorts. Embroidery and
muslins are made in this half-canton, though wholly at home by
the work-people. But it is very largely pastoral, containing 168
mountain pastures or &ldquo;alps,&rdquo; maintaining each summer 4000
cows, and of an estimated capital value of 2,682,955 francs (the
figures for Ausser Rhoden are respectively 100 alps, 2800 cows,
and 1,749,900 francs). Inner Rhoden is extremely conservative,
and has the reputation of always rejecting any federal <i>Referendum</i>.
For similar reasons it has preserved many old customs
and costumes, those of the women being very elaborate and
picturesque, while the herdsmen have retained their festival
attire of red waistcoats, embroidered braces and canary-coloured
shorts. It sends one member (named by the <i>Landsgemeinde</i>) to
the federal <i>Ständerath</i>, and one also to the federal <i>Nationalrath</i>,
while it forms but a single administrative district, though divided
into six communes.</p>

<p>To the outer world the canton of Appenzell is best known by
its institution of <i>Landsgemeinden</i>, or primitive democratic
assemblies held in the open air, in which every male citizen
(not being disqualified) over twenty years of age must (under a
money penalty) appear personally: each half-canton has such
an assembly of its own, that of Inner Rhoden always meeting
at Appenzell, and that of Ausser Rhoden in the odd years at
Hundwil (near Herisau) and in the even years at Trogen. This
institution is of immemorial antiquity, and the meetings in either
case are always held on the last Sunday in April. The <i>Landsgemeinde</i>
is the supreme legislative authority, and elects both the
executive (in Inner Rhoden composed of nine members and called
<i>Ständeskommission</i>, and in Ausser Rhoden of seven members
and called <i>Regierungsrath</i>) and the president or <i>Landammann</i>;
in each half-canton there is also a sort of standing committee
(composed of the members of the executive and representatives
from the communes&mdash;in Inner Rhoden one member per 250 or
fraction over 125 of the population, and in Ausser Rhoden one
member per 1000 of the inhabitants) which prepares business for
the <i>Landsgemeinde</i> and decides minor matters; in Inner Rhoden
it is named the <i>Grossrath</i> and in Ausser Rhoden the <i>Kantonsrath</i>.
As various old-fashioned ceremonies are observed at the meetings
and the members each appear with his girded sword, the sight of
a meeting of the <i>Landsgemeinde</i> is most striking and interesting.
The existing constitution of Inner Rhoden dates mainly from
1872, and that of Ausser Rhoden from 1876.</p>

<p>By the middle of the 11th century the abbots of St Gall had
established their power in the land later called Appenzell, which,
too, became thoroughly teutonized, its early inhabitants having
probably been romanized Raetians. But as early as 1377, this
portion of the abbots&rsquo; domains formed an alliance with the
Swabian free imperial cities and adopted a constitution of its
own. The repeated attempts of the abbots to put down this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span>
independence of their rule were defeated in the battles of
Vögelinsegg (1403), north-west of Trogen, and of the Stoss (1405),
the pass leading from Gais over to Altstätten in the Rhine valley.
In 1411 Appenzell was placed under the &ldquo;protection&rdquo; of the
Swiss Confederation, of which, in 1452, it became an &ldquo;allied
member,&rdquo; and in 1513 a full member. Religious differences
broke up the land after the Reformation into two portions, each
called <i>Rhoden</i>, a term that in the singular is said to mean a
&ldquo;clearing,&rdquo; and occurs in 1070, long before the final separation.
From 1798 to 1803 Appenzell, with the other domains of the abbot
of St Gall, was formed into the canton Säntis of the Helvetic
Republic, but in 1803, on the creation of the new canton of St
Gall, shrank back within its former boundaries. The oldest
codes of the laws and customs of the land date from 1409 and
1585, the original MS. of the latter (called the &ldquo;Silver Book&rdquo;
from its silver clasps) being still used in Inner Rhoden when, at
the close of the annual <i>Landsgemeinde</i>, the newly elected <i>Landammann</i>
first takes the oath of office, and the assembled members
then take that of obedience to him, in either case with uplifted
right hands.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APPENZELL,<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> the political capital of the Inner Rhoden half
of the Swiss canton of Appenzell. It is built in a smiling green
hollow on the left bank of the Sitter stream, which is formed by
the union of several mountain torrents descending from the
Säntis. By light railways it is 12½ m. from St Gall past Gais or
20½ m. past Herisau. Its chief streets are paved, but it is rather
a large village than a town, though in 1900 it had 4574 inhabitants,
practically all German-speaking and Romanists. It has a
stately modern parish church (attached to a Gothic choir), a
small but very ancient chapel of the abbots of St Gall (whose
summer residence was this village), and two Capuchin convents
(one for men, founded in 1588, and one for women, founded in
1613). Among the archives, kept in the sacristy of the church,
are several banners captured by the Appenzellers in former
days, among them one taken in 1406 at Imst, near Lanedeck,
with the inscription <i>Hundert Teufel</i>, though popularly this
number is multiplied a thousandfold. In the principal square
the <i>Landsgemeinde</i> (or cantonal democratic assembly) is held
annually in the open air on the last Sunday in April. The
inhabitants are largely employed in the production of embroidery,
though also engaged in various pastoral occupations. About
2½ m. by road south-east of Appenzell is Weissbad, a well-known
goat&rsquo;s whey cure establishment, while 1½ hours above it is the
quaint little chapel of Wildkirchli, built (1648) in a rock cavern,
on the way to the Säntis.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APPERCEPTION<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> (Lat. <i>ad</i> and <i>percipere</i>, perceive), in
psychology, a term used to describe the presentation of an
object on which attention is fixed, in relation to the sum of
consciousness previous to the presentation and the mind as a
whole. The word was first used by Leibnitz, practically in the
sense of the modern Attention (<i>q.v.</i>), by which an object is
apprehended as &ldquo;not-self&rdquo; and yet in relation to the self. In
Kantian terminology apperception is (1) <i>transcendental</i>&mdash;the
perception of an object as involving the consciousness of the
pure self as subject, and (2) <i>empirical</i>,&mdash;the cognition of the self
in its concrete existence. In (1) apperception is almost equivalent
to self-consciousness; the existence of the ego may be more
or less prominent, but it is always involved. According to J.F.
Herbart (<i>q.v.</i>) apperception is that process by which an aggregate
or &ldquo;mass&rdquo; of presentations becomes systematized (<i>apperceptions-system</i>)
by the accretion of new elements, either sense-given or
product of the inner workings of the mind. He thus emphasizes
in apperception the connexion with the self as resulting from
the sum of antecedent experience. Hence in education the
teacher should fully acquaint himself with the mental development
of the pupil, in order that he may make full use of what
the pupil already knows.</p>

<p>Apperception is thus a general term for all mental processes
in which a presentation is brought into connexion with an
already existent and systematized mental conception, and
thereby is classified, explained or, in a word, understood;
<i>e.g.</i> a new scientific phenomenon is explained in the light of
phenomena already analysed and classified. The whole intelligent
life of man is, consciously or unconsciously, a process
of apperception, inasmuch as every act of attention involves the
appercipient process.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APPERLEY, CHARLES JAMES<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> (1777-1843), English sportsman
and sporting writer, better known as &ldquo;Nimrod,&rdquo; the
pseudonym under which he published his works on the chase
and the turf, was born at Plasgronow, near Wrexham, in Denbighshire,
in 1777. Between the years 1805 and 1820 he devoted
himself to fox-hunting. About 1821 he began to contribute to
the <i>Sporting Magazine</i>, under the pseudonym of &ldquo;Nimrod,&rdquo; a
series of racy articles, which helped to double the circulation
of the magazine in a year or two. The proprietor, Mr Pittman,
kept for &ldquo;Nimrod&rdquo; a stud of hunters, and defrayed all expenses
of his tours, besides giving him a handsome salary. The death
of Mr Pittman, however, led to a law-suit with the proprietors
of the magazine for money advanced, and Apperley, to avoid
imprisonment, had to take up his residence near Calais (1830),
where he supported himself by his writings. He died in London
on the 19th of May 1843. The most important of his works are:

the <i>Quarterly Review</i>), (1837); <i>Memoirs of the Life of the Late

<p><span class="bold">APPERT, BENJAMIN NICOLAS MARIE<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> (1797-1847), French
philanthropist, was born in Paris on the 10th of September 1797.
While a young man he introduced a system of mutual instruction
into the regimental schools of the department of the Nord. The
success which it obtained induced him to publish a <i>Manual</i>
setting forth his system. While engaged in teaching prisoners at
Montaigu, he fell under the suspicion of having connived at the
escape of two of them, and was thrown into the prison of La
Force. On his release he resolved to devote the rest of his life
to bettering the condition of those whose lot he had for a time
shared, and he travelled much over Europe for the purpose of
studying the various systems of prison discipline, and wrote
several books on the subject. After the revolution of 1830 he
became secretary to Queen Marie Amélie, and organized the
measures taken for the relief of the needy. He was decorated
with the Legion of Honour in 1833.</p>

<p>His brother, <span class="sc">François Appert</span> (d. 1840), was the inventor of

<p><span class="bold">APPIANI, ANDREA<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (1754-1817), the best fresco painter of his
age, was born at Milan. He was made pensioned artist to the
kingdom of Italy by Napoleon, but lost his allowance after the
events of 1814 and fell into poverty. Correggio was his model,
and his best pieces, which are in the church of Santa Maria presso
San Celso and the royal palace at Milan, almost rival those of
his great master. He also painted Napoleon and the chief
personages of his court. Among the most graceful of his oil-paintings
are his &ldquo;Venus and Love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rinaldo in the
Garden of Armida.&rdquo; He is known as &ldquo;the elder,&rdquo; to distinguish
him from his great-nephew Andrea Appiani (1817-1865), an
historical painter at Rome. Other painters of the same name
were Niccolo Appiani (fl. 1510) and Francesco Appiani (1704-1792).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APPIA, VIA,<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> a high-road leading from Rome to Campania
and lower Italy, constructed in 312 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by the censor Appius
Claudius Caecus. It originally ran only as far as Capua, but was
successively prolonged to Beneventum, Venusia, Tarentum and
Brundusium, though at what dates is unknown. Probably it
was extended as far as Beneventum not long after the colonization
of this town in 268 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and it seems to have reached
Venusia before 190 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Horace, in the journey to Brundusium
described in <i>Sat</i>. i. 5, followed the Via Appia as far as
Beneventum, but not beyond.</p>

<p>The original road was no doubt only gravelled (<i>glarea strata</i>);
in 298 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> a footpath was laid <i>saxo quadrato</i> from the Porta
Capena, by which it left Rome, to the temple of Mars, about 1 m.
from the gate. Three years later, however, the whole road was
paved with <i>silex</i> from the temple to Bovillae, and in 191 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
the first mile from the gate to the temple was similarly treated.
The distance from Rome to Capua was 132 m. For the first few
miles the road is flanked by an uninterrupted series of tombs
and other buildings (see L. Canina, <i>Via Appia</i>, Rome, 1853).
As far as Terracina it ran in an almost entirely straight line,
even through the Alban Hills, where the gradients are steep.
A remarkably fine embankment belonging to it still exists at
Aricia. At Forum Appii it entered the Pomptine Marshes;
that this portion (19 m. long, hence called Decennovium) belonged
to the original road was proved by the discovery at Ad Medias
(Mesa) of a milestone of about 250 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (Ch. Hülsen, in <i>Römische
Mitteilungen</i>, 1889, 83; 1895, 301). A still older road ran along
the foot of the Volscian mountains past Cora, Norba and Setia;
this served as the post road until the end of the 18th century.
At the time of Strabo and Horace, however, it was the practice
to travel by canal from Forum Appii to Lucus Feroniae; to
Nerva and Trajan were due the paving of the road and the repair
of the bridges along this section. Theodoric in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 486 ordered
the execution of similar repairs, the success of which is recorded
in inscriptions, but in the middle ages it was abandoned and
impassable, and was only renewed by Pius VI. The older road
crossed the back of the promontory at the foot of which Terracina
stands; in imperial times, probably, the rock was cut away
perpendicularly for a height of 120 ft. to allow the road to pass.
Beyond Fundi it passed through the mountains to Formiae, the
engineering of the road being noteworthy; and thence by
Minturnae and Sinuessa (towns of the Aurunci which had been
conquered in 314 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> to Capua. The remains of the road in
this first portion are particularly striking.</p>

<p>Between Capua and Beneventum, a distance of 32 m., the
road passed near the defile of Caudium (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caudine Forks</a></span>).
The modern highroad follows the ancient line, and remains of the
latter, with the exception of three well-preserved bridges, which
still serve for the modern highroad, are conspicuous by their
absence. The portion of the road from Rome to Beneventum is
described by Sir R. Colt Hoare, <i>Classical Tour through Italy</i>,
57 seq. (London, 1819). He was accompanied on his journey,
made in 1789, by the artist Carlo Labruzzi, who executed a series
of 226 drawings, the greater part of which have not been published;
they are described by T. Ashby in <i>Mélanges de l&rsquo;École
Française de Rome</i> (1903), p. 375 seq., and <i>Atti del Congresso Internazionale
per le Scienze Storiche</i>, vol. v. (Rome, 1904), p. 125 seq.</p>

<p>From Beneventum to Brundusium by the Via Appia, through
Venusia and Tarentum, was 202 m. A shorter route, but more
fitted for mule traffic, though Horace drove along part of it,<a name="fa2f" id="fa2f" href="#ft2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
ran by Aequum Tuticum, Aecae, Herdoniae, Canusium, Barium,
and Gnatia (Strabo vi. 282); it was made into a main road by
Trajan, and took the name Via Traiana. The original road, too,
adopted in imperial times a more devious but easier route by
Aeclanum instead of by Trevicum. This was restored by
Hadrian for the 15 m. between Beneventum and Aeclanum.
Under Diocletian and Maximian a road (the Via Herculia) was
constructed from Aequum Tuticum to Pons Aufidi near Venusia,
where it crossed the Via Appia and went on into Lucania, passing
through Potentia and Grumentum, and joining the Via Popilia
near Nerulum. Though it must have lost much of its importance
through the construction of the Via Traiana, the last portion
from Tarentum to Brundusium was restored by Constantine
about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 315.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Via Appia was the most famous of Roman roads; Statius,

important roads of Italy. A large number of milestones and other

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APPLAUSE<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> (Lat. <i>applaudere</i>, to strike upon, clap), primarily
the expression of approval by clapping of hands, &amp;c.; generally
any expression of approval. The custom of applauding is doubtless
as old and as widespread as humanity, and the variety of its
forms is limited only by the capacity for devising means of
making a noise. Among civilized nations, however, it has at
various times been subject to certain conventions. Thus the
Romans had a set ritual of applause for public performances,
expressing degrees of approval: snapping the finger and thumb,
clapping with the flat or hollow palm, waving the flap of the toga,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
for which last the emperor Aurelian substituted a handkerchief
(<i>orarium</i>), distributed to all Roman citizens (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stole</a></span>). In
the theatre, at the close of the play, the chief actor called out
&ldquo;Valete et plaudite!&rdquo;, and the audience, guided by an unofficial
choregus, chaunted their applause antiphonally. This was
often organized and paid for (Böttiger, <i>Über das Applaudieren
im Theater bei den Alten</i>, Leipz., 1822). When Christianity
became fashionable the customs of the theatre were transferred
to the churches. Eusebius (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i> vii. 30) says that Paul
of Samosata encouraged the congregation to applaud his preaching
by waving linen cloths (<span class="grk" title="othonais">&#8000;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#962;</span>), and in the 4th and 5th
centuries applause of the rhetoric of popular preachers had
become an established custom. Though, however, applause
may provide a healthy stimulus, its abuse has led to attempts
at abolishing or restricting it even in theatres. The institution
of the <i>claque</i>, people hired by performers to applaud them, has
largely discredited the custom, and indiscriminate applause has
been felt as an intolerable interruption to serious performances.
The reverential spirit which abolished applause in church has
tended to spread to the theatre and the concert-room, largely
under the influence of the quasi-religious atmosphere of the
Wagner performances at Baireuth. In Germany (<i>e.g.</i> the court
theatres at Berlin) applause during the performance and
&ldquo;calling before the curtain&rdquo; have been officially forbidden, but
even in Germany this is felt to be in advance of public opinion.

<p><span class="bold">APPLE<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> (a common Teut. word, A.S. <i>aepl, aeppel</i>, O.H.G. <i>aphul,
aphal, apfal</i>, mod. Ger. <i>Apfel</i>), the fruit of <i>Pyrus Malus</i>, belonging
to the sub-order <i>Pomaceae</i>, of the natural order <i>Rosaceae</i>. It
is one of the most widely cultivated and best-known and appreciated
of fruits belonging to temperate climates. In its wild state
it is known as the crab-apple, and is found generally distributed
throughout Europe and western Asia, growing in as high a
latitude as Trondhjem in Norway. The crabs of Siberia belong
to different species of <i>Pyrus</i>. The apple-tree as cultivated is a
moderate-sized tree with spreading branches, ovate, acutely
serrated or crenated leaves, and flowers in corymbs. The fruit is
too well known to need any description of its external characteristics.
The apple is successfully cultivated in higher latitudes
than any other fruit tree, growing up to 65° N., but notwithstanding
this, its blossoms are more susceptible of injury from
frost than the flowers of the peach or apricot. It comes into
flower much later than these trees, and so avoids the night
frost which would be fatal to its fruit-bearing. The apples which
are grown in northern regions are, however, small, hard, and
crabbed, the best fruit being produced in hot summer climates,
such as Canada and the United States. Besides in Europe and
America, the fruit is now cultivated at the Cape of Good Hope,
in northern India and China, and in Australia and New
Zealand.</p>

<p>Apples have been cultivated in Great Britain probably since
the period of the Roman occupation, but the names of many
varieties indicate a French or Dutch origin of much later date.
In 1688 Ray enumerated seventy-eight varieties in cultivation
in the neighbourhood of London, and now it is calculated that
about 2000 kinds can be distinguished. According to the
purposes for which they are suitable, they can be classed as&mdash;
1st, dessert; 2nd, culinary; and 3rd, cider apples. The
principal dessert apples are the Pippins (<i>pepins</i>, seedlings), of
which there are numerous varieties. As culinary apples, besides
Rennets and other dessert kinds, Codlins and Biffins are cultivated.
In England, Herefordshire and Devonshire are famous
for the cultivation of apples, and in these counties the manufacture
of cider (<i>q.v.</i>) is an important industry. Cider is also
extensively prepared in Normandy and in Holland. Verjuice is
the fermented juice of crab apples.</p>

<p>A large trade in the importation of apples is carried on in
Britain, imports coming chiefly from French, Belgian and Dutch
growers, and from the United States and British North America.
Dried and pressed apples are imported from France for stewing,
under the name of Normandy Pippins, and similarly prepared
fruits come also from America.</p>

<p>The apple may be propagated by seeds to obtain stocks for
grafting, and also for the production of new varieties. The
established sorts are usually increased by grafting, the method
called whip-grafting being preferred. The stocks should be at
least as thick as the finger; and should be headed back to where
the graft is to be fixed in January, unless the weather is frosty,
but in any case before vegetation becomes active. The scions
should be cut about the same time, and laid in firmly in a trench,
in contact with the moist soil, until required.</p>

<p>The tree will thrive in any good well-drained soil, the best
being a good mellow calcareous loam, while the less iron there is in
the subsoil the better. The addition of marl to soils that are not
naturally calcareous very much improves them. The trees are
liable to canker in undrained soils or those of a hot sandy nature.
Where the soil is not naturally rich enough, it should be well
manured, but not to the extent of encouraging over-luxuriance.
It is better to apply manure in the form of a compost than to use
it in a fresh state or unmixed.</p>

<p>To form an orchard, standard trees should be planted at from
25 to 40 ft. between the rows, according to the fertility of the soil
and other considerations. The trees should be selected with
clean, straight, self-supporting stems, and the head should be
shapely and symmetrical, with the main branches well balanced.
In order to obtain such a stem, all the leaves on the first shoot
from the graft or bud should be encouraged to grow, and in the
second season the terminal bud should be allowed to develop a
further leading shoot, while the lateral shoots should be allowed
to grow, but so that they do not compete with the leader, on
which the growth of leaves should be encouraged in order that
they may give additional strength to the stem below them. The
side shoots should be removed gradually, so that the diminution of
foliage in this direction may not exceed the increase made by the
new branches and shoots of the upper portion. Dwarf pyramids,
which occupy less space than open dwarfs, if not allowed to grow
tall, may be planted at from 10 to 12 ft. apart. Dwarf bush trees
may be planted from 10 to 15 ft. apart, according to the variety
and the soil. Dwarf bushes on the Paradise stock are both ornamental
and useful in small gardens, the trees being always
conveniently under control. These bush trees, which must be
on the proper stock&mdash;the French Paradise&mdash;may be planted at
first 6 ft. apart, with the same distance between the rows, the
space being afterwards increased, if desired, to 12 ft. apart, by
removing every alternate row.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cordons&rdquo; are trees trained to a single shoot, the laterals of
which are kept spurred. They are usually trained horizontally,
at about 1½ ft. from the ground, and may consist of one stem or
of two, the stems in the latter case being trained in opposite
directions. In cold districts the finer sorts of apples may be
grown against walls as upright or oblique cordons. From these
cordon trees very fine fruit may often be obtained. The apple may
also be grown as an espalier tree, a form which does not require
much lateral space. The ordinary trained trees for espaliers and
walls should be planted 20 ft. apart.</p>

<p>The fruit of the apple is produced on spurs which form on the
branchlets of two years old and upwards, and continue fertile for
a series of years. The principal pruning should be performed in
summer, the young shoots if crowded being thinned out, and the
superabundant laterals shortened by breaking them half through.
The general winter pruning of the trees may take place any time
from the beginning of November to the beginning of March, in
open weather. The trees are rather subject to the attacks of the
American blight, the white cottony substance found on the bark
and developed by an insect (<i>Eriosoma, mali</i>), somewhat similar
to the green-fly of the garden, but not a true aphis. It may be
removed by scrubbing with a hard brush, by painting the affected
spots with any bland oil, or by washing them with dilute paraffin
and soft soap.</p>

<p>The apple-blossom weevil (<i>Anthonomus pomorum</i>), a small
reddish-brown beetle, often causes serious damage to the flowers.
The female bores and lays an egg in the unopened bud, and the
maggot feeds on the stamens and pistil. The weevil hibernates
in the crannies of the bark or in the soil at the base of the trees,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
and bandages of tarred doth placed round the stem in spring
will prevent the female from crawling up.</p>

<p>The codlin moth (<i>Carpocapsa pomonana</i>) lays its eggs in May
in the calyx of the flowers. The young caterpillar, which is
white with black head and neck, gnaws its way through the fruit,
and pierces the rind. When nearly full grown it attacks the core,
and the fruit soon drops. The insect emerges and spins its
cocoon in a crack of the bark.</p>

<p>To check this disease the apples which fall before ripening
should be promptly removed. A loosely made hay-band twisted
round the stem about a foot from the ground is of use. The
grubs will generally choose the bands in which to make their
cocoon; at the end of the season the bands are collected and
burned.</p>

<p>The following are a few of the most approved varieties of the
apple tree, arranged in order of their ripening, with the months
in which they are in use:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="bold">APPLEBY,<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough, and
the county town of Westmorland, England, in the Appleby
parliamentary division, 276 m. N.N.W. from London, on the
Midland and a branch of the North Eastern railways. Pop.
(1901) 1764. It is picturesquely placed in the valley of the Eden,
which is richly wooded, and flanked on the north-east by spurs of
Milburn Forest and Dufton and other fells, which rise up to
2600 ft. On a hill above the town stands the castle, retaining a
fine Norman keep and surrounded by a double moat, now partly
laid out as gardens. The remainder of the castle was rebuilt as a
mansion in the 17th century. It was held for the royalists in the
civil wars by Sir Philip Musgrave, and was the residence of Anne,
countess of Pembroke, the last of the family of Clifford, which
had great estates in this part of England. St Ann&rsquo;s hospital
for thirteen poor women (1654) was of her foundation. The
grammar school (1453) was refounded by Queen Elizabeth.
The modern incorporation dates from 1885, with a mayor, four
aldermen and twelve councillors. Area, 1876 acres.</p>

<p>Appleby is not mentioned in any Saxon records, but after
the Conquest it rose to importance as the head of the barony
of Appleby which extended over the eastern portion of the
present county of Westmorland. This barony formed part of
the province of Carlisle granted by Henry I. to Ranulf Meschin,
who erected the castle at Appleby and made it his place of
residence. Appleby is a borough by prescription, and the old
charter of incorporation, granted in the first year of James II.,
was very shortly abandoned. In 1292 we find the mayor and
commonalty claiming the right to elect a coroner and to have
tolls of markets and fairs. In 1685 the governing body comprised
a mayor, aldermen, a town clerk, burgesses of the common
council, a coroner and subordinate officers. An undated charter
from Henry II. conceding to the burgesses the customs of York,
Was confirmed in 1 John, 16 Henry III., 14 Edward I., and
5 Edward III. John granted the borough to the burgesses for
a fee-farm rent. The impoverishment caused by the Scottish
raids led to its seizure by Edward II. for arrears of payment,
but Edward III. restored it on the same terms as before. Henry
VIII. reduced the fee-farm rent from 20 marks to 2 marks, after
an inquisition which found that Appleby was burnt by the Scots
in 1388 and that part of it still lay in ruins. The town, however,
never seems to have regained its prosperity, and 16th and 17th
century writers speak of it as a poor and insignificant village.
Appleby returned two members to parliament from 1295 until
disfranchised by the Reform Act of 1832. The market and the
St Lawrence fair are held by prescription. James I. granted an
additional fair on the second Thursday in April. In the early
18th century Appleby was celebrated for the best corn-market
in the country.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APPLETON, NATHAN<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> (1770-1861) American merchant and
politician, was born in New Ipswich, New Hampshire, on the
6th of October 1779. He was educated in the New Ipswich
Academy, and in 1794 entered mercantile life in Boston, in the
employment of his brother, Samuel (1766-1853), a successful and
benevolent man of business, with whom he was in partnership
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
from 1800 to 1809. He co-operated with Francis C. Lowell and
others in introducing the power-loom and the manufacture of
cotton on a large scale into the United States, a factory being
established at Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1814, and another
in 1822 at Lowell, Massachusetts, of which city he was one of
the founders. He was a member of the general court of Massachusetts
in 1816, 1821, 1822, 1824 and 1827, and in 1831-1833
and 1842 of the national House of Representatives, in which he
was prominent as an advocate of protective duties. He died in
Boston on the 14th of July 1861.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Thomas Gold Appleton</span> (1812-1884), who graduated
at Harvard in 1831, had some reputation as a writer, an artist
and a patron of the fine arts, but was better known for his
witticisms, one of which, the oft-quoted &ldquo;Good Americans,
when they die, go to Paris,&rdquo; is sometimes attributed to Oliver
Wendell Holmes. He published some poems and, in prose,
<i>Nile Journal</i> (1876), <i>Syrian Sunshine</i> (1877), <i>Windfalls</i> (1878),
and <i>Chequer-Work</i> (1879).</p>

<p><span class="bold">APPLETON,<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Outagamie county,
Wisconsin, U.S.A., on the lower Fox river, about 90 m. N. of
Milwaukee. Pop. (1890) 11,869; (1900) 15,085, of whom 3605
were foreign-born; (1910, census) 16,773. It is served by the
Chicago &amp; North-Western, and the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St
Paul railways, and by steamboats on the Fox river, by means of
which it meets lake transportation at De Pere and Green Bay.
Appleton was one of the first cities in the United States to have
an electric street railway line in operation; and electric street
railways now traverse the entire Fox river valley as far as
Fond du Lac on the south and Green Bay on the north. The
city is attractively laid out on high bluffs above the river.
It has several beautiful parks, two hospitals, a number of fine
churches and school buildings, and a public library. The city
is the seat of Lawrence college (changed from university in 1908),
an interdenominational (originally a Methodist Episcopal)
co-educational institution, founded in 1847 as the Lawrence
Institute of Wisconsin and named in honour of Amos Adams
Lawrence (1814-1886) of Boston, son of Amos Lawrence, and
giver of $10,000 for the founding of the Institute. The college
comprises an academy, a college of liberal arts, a school of
expression, a school of commerce, schools of music and of art,
and a school of correspondence; and in 1907-1908 had 33
instructors, 575 students and a library of 24,400 volumes. The
Fox river furnishes about 10,000 h.p., which is largely utilized
for the manufacture of paper (of which Appleton is one of the
largest producers in the United States), wood-pulp, sulphite
fibre, machinery, wire screens, woollen goods, knit goods, furniture,
dyes and flour. The total value of factory products in
1905 was $6,672,457, an increase of 72.8% over the product
value of 1900. Appleton was first permanently settled in 1833,
and was named in honour of Samuel Appleton of Massachusetts,
who owned part of the original town plot. It was incorporated
as a village in 1853, and received in 1857 a city charter, which
was revised in 1887 and in 1905.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APPOGGIATURA<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> (from Ital. <i>appoggiare</i>, to lean upon), a
musical term for a melodic ornament, a grace-note prefixed to a
principal note and printed in small character. The effect is
to suspend the principal note, by taking away the time-value of
the <i>appoggiatura</i> prefixed to it. There are two kinds, the long
<i>appoggiatura</i>, now usually printed as played, and the short,
where the suspension of the principal note is scarcely perceptible;
this is often called <i>acciatura</i>, a word properly applied to an
ornament now obsolete, in which a principal note in a melody is
struck together with the note immediately below, the lower note
being at once released and the other held on.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APPOINTMENT, POWER OF,<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> in English law, an authority
reserved by or limited to a person, to dispose, either wholly or
partially, of real or personal property, either for his own benefit
or for that of others. Thus if A settle property upon trustees
to such uses as B shall by deed or will appoint and in default of
and until such appointment to the use of C and his heirs, B,
though he has no interest in the property, can at any time
appoint the property to any one he pleases, including himself,
and C&rsquo;s interest which has hitherto been vested in him will be
divested. In the above case A is said to be the donor, B the
donee, and the persons in whose favour the appointment is
exercised are called the appointees. Such powers are either
general or limited. A general power is one which the appointor
may exercise in favour of any person he pleases. It is obvious
that such a power is very nearly equivalent to ownership, and
consequently property which is the subject of a general power
has been made to share the liabilities of ownership. By the
Judgments Act 1838 all hereditaments over which a judgment
debtor has such a power may be seized by the sheriff under a
writ of <i>elegit</i>, and by the Bankruptcy Act 1883 similar property
will vest in the trustees of a bankrupt. By the Finance Act 1894
property of which the deceased had a general power of appointment
is subject to the payment of estate duty, even though the
power has not been exercised. A limited power is one which
can only be exercised in favour of certain specified persons or
classes; such a power is frequently inserted in marriage settlements
in which after life estates to the husband and wife a power
is given to appoint among the children of the marriage. In such
a case no appointment to any one but children of the marriage is
valid. Formerly it was held that the intention of the donor of
such a power was that each of the class which are the objects of
the power should take some part of the fund, and from this arose
the equitable doctrine of illusory appointments, by which the
courts of equity set aside an appointment which was good at
law on the ground that a merely nominal share had been
appointed to one of the objects. The great difficulty of deciding
what was a nominal or illusory share caused the passing of the
Illusory Appointments Act of 1830, whereby it was enacted
that no appointment should be set aside merely on the ground
that a share appointed was illusory. It was still necessary,
however, that some share should be appointed to each object,
and consequently it was possible in the popular phrase to be
&ldquo;cut off with a shilling,&rdquo; but now by the Powers Amendment Act
1874 the appointor is no longer obliged to appoint a share to
each object of the power.</p>

<p>It is a general rule that every circumstance required by the
instrument creating the power to accompany the execution of it
must be strictly observed. Thus it might be required that the
appointment should be by an instrument witnessed by four
witnesses, or that the consent in writing of some third party
should be signified. The general rule, however, has been modified
both by statute and by the rules of equity. By the Wills Act 1837
a will made pursuant to the requirements of that statute shall be
a valid execution of a power of appointment by will, notwithstanding
that some additional form or solemnity shall have been
required by the instrument creating the power, and by the Wills
Act 1861 a will made out of the United Kingdom by a British
subject according to the forms required by the law of the place
where the will was made shall, as regards personal estate, be
held to be well executed and admitted to probate; consequently
it has been held that an appointment made by such a will is a
valid exercise of the power. As regards appointments by deed
the Law of Property Amendment Act 1859 enacts that a deed
attested by two witnesses shall, so far as execution and attestation
go, be a valid exercise of a power to appoint by deed. The
courts of equity also will interfere in some cases of defective
execution in order to carry out the intentions of the settlor.
The principle upon which the court acts is obscure, but the rule
has been thus stated:&mdash;&ldquo;Whenever a man having power over
an estate, whether ownership or not, in discharge of moral or
natural relations, shows an intention to execute such power,
the court will operate upon the conscience of the heir (or of the
persons entitled in default) to make him perfect this intention.&rdquo;
Equity, however, only relieves against defects not of the essence
of the power, such as the absence of seal or execution by will
instead of deed, but where the defect is of the essence of the
power, as where a consent is not obtained, equity will not assist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
nor will it relieve where a power to appoint by will is purported
to be exercised by deed. A power of appointment if exercised
must be exercised bona fide, otherwise it will be void as fraudulent;
thus it has been frequently decided that where a father,
having a limited power of appointment among his children,
appoints the whole fund to an infant child, who is in no need
of the appointment and who is ill, in the expectation of the
death of the child whereby the fund will come to him as next of
kin, such appointment is void as a fraud upon the power. Where
an execution is partly fraudulent and partly valid the court will,
if possible, separate the two and only revoke that which is
fraudulent; if, however, the two parts are not separable the
whole is void. The same rule is applied in cases of excessive
execution where the power is exercised in favour of persons
some of whom are and some of whom are not objects of the power.
The doctrine of <i>Election</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) applies to appointments under
powers, but there must be a gift of free and disposable property
to the persons entitled in default of appointment.</p>

<p>The appointment must in law be read into the instrument
creating the power in lieu of the power itself. Thus an appointor
under a limited power cannot appoint to any person to whom the
donor could not have appointed by reason of the rule against
perpetuities, but this is not so in the case of a general power,
for there the appointor is virtually owner of the property
appointed. In applying this rule to appointments a distinction
arises between powers created by deed and will, for a deed
speaks from the date of its execution but a will from the death
of the testator, and so limitations bad when the will was made
may have become good when it comes into operation. Since the
Conveyancing Act 1881 all powers may be released by the
donees thereof, unless the power is coupled with a trust in
respect of which there is a duty cast on the donee to exercise it;
and this is so even though the donee gets a benefit by such

The village was the scene of the surrender of the Confederate

the Federal forces under Lieutenant-General U.S. Grant on
Sunday the 9th of April 1865. The terms were: &ldquo;the officers to

government of the United States until properly exchanged,
and each company or regimental commander to sign a like
parole for the men of their commands,&rdquo; ... neither &ldquo;side arms

<p><span class="bold">APPONYI, ALBERT,<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count</span> (1846-&emsp;&emsp;), Hungarian statesman,
the most distinguished member of an ancient noble family,
dating back to the 13th century, and son of the chancellor
Gyorgy Apponyi (1808-1899) and the accomplished and saintly
Countess Julia Sztáray, was born at Pesth on the 29th of May
1846. Educated at the Jesuit seminary at Kalksburg and at the
universities of Vienna and Pesth, a long foreign tour completed
his curriculum, and at Paris he made the acquaintance of
Montalembert, a kindred spirit, whose influence on the young
Apponyi was permanent. He entered parliament in 1872 as a
liberal Catholic, attaching himself at first to the Deák party;
but the feudal and ultramontane traditions of his family circle
profoundly modified, though they could never destroy, his
popular ideals. On the break up of the Deák party he attached
himself to the conservative group which followed Baron Pál
Senynyey (1824-1888) and eventually became its leader. Until
1905 Count Albert was constantly in opposition, but in May of
that year he consented to take office in the second Wekerle
ministry. A lofty and magnetic orator, his speeches were
published at Budapest in 1896; and he is the author of an
interesting dissertation, <i>Esthetics and Politics, the Artist and the
Statesman</i> (Hung.) (Budapest, 1895).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APPORTIONMENT<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> (Fr. <i>apportionement;</i> Med. Lat. <i>apportionamentum;</i>
derived from Lat. portio, share), distribution or
allotment in proper shares; a term used in law in a variety of
senses, (1) Sometimes it is employed roughly and with no
technical meaning to indicate the distribution of a benefit (<i>e.g.</i>
salvage or damages under the Fatal Accidents Act 1846, § 2), or
liability (<i>e.g.</i> general average contributions, or tithe rent-charge),
or the incidence of a duty (<i>e.g.</i> obligations as to the maintenance
of highways). (2) In its strict legal interpretation apportionment
falls into two classes, &ldquo;apportionment in respect of
estate&rdquo; and &ldquo;apportionment in respect of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>1. <i>Apportionment in respect of Estate</i> may result either from the
act of the parties or from the operation of law. Where a lessee
is evicted from, or surrenders or forfeits possession of part of
the property leased to him, he becomes liable at common law
to pay only a rent apportioned to the value of the interest which
he still retains. So where the person entitled to the reversion of
an estate assigns part of it, the right to an apportioned part of the
rent incident to the whole reversion passes to his assignee. The
lessee is not bound, however, by an apportionment of rent
made upon the grant of part of the reversion unless it is made
either with his consent or by the verdict of a jury. The assignee
of the reversion of part of demised premises could not, at common
law, re-enter for breach of a condition, inasmuch as a condition
of re-entry in a lease could not at common law be apportioned.
But this has now been altered by statute both in England (Law
of Property Amendment Act 1859, § 3; Conveyancing Act 1881,
§ 12) and in many of the British colonies (<i>e.g.</i> Ontario, Rev. Stats.,
1897, c. 170, § 9; Barbados, No. 12 of 1891, § 9). In the cases
just mentioned there is apportionment in respect of estate by act
of the parties.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Apportionment by operation of law</i> may be brought about where
by act of law a lease becomes inoperative as regards its subject-matter,
or by the &ldquo;act of God&rdquo; (as, for instance, where part of an
estate is submerged by the encroachments of the sea). To the same
category belongs the apportionment of rent which takes place under
various statutes (<i>e.g.</i> the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845,
§ 119, when land is required for public purposes; the Agricultural
Holdings Act 1883, § 41, in the case of a tenant from year to year
receiving notice to quit part of a holding; and the Irish Land Act
1903, § 61, apportionment of quit and crown rents).</p>
</div>

<p><i>2. Apportionment in respect of Time.</i>&mdash;At common law, there
was no apportionment of rent in respect of time. Such apportionment
was, however, in ceftain cases allowed in England by the
Distress for Rent Act 1737, and the Apportionment Act 1834,
and is now allowed generally under the Apportionment Act 1870.
Under that statute (§ 2) all rents, annuities, dividends and other
periodical payments in the nature of income are to be considered
as accruing from day to day and to be apportionable in respect
of time accordingly. It is provided, however, that the apportioned
part of such rents, &amp;c., shall only be payable or recoverable
in the case of a continuing payment, when the entire portion
of which it forms part itself becomes payable, and, in the case
of a payment determined by re-entry, death or otherwise, only
when the next entire portion would have been payable if it had
not so determined (§ 3). Persons entitled to apportioned parts
of rent have the same remedies for recovering them when payable
as they would have had in respect of the entire rent; but a lessee
is not to be liable for any apportioned part specifically. The rent
is recoverable by the heir or other person who would, but for the
apportionment, be entitled to the entire rent, and he holds it
subject to distribution (§ 4). The Apportionment Act 1870
extends to payments not made under any instrument in writing
(§ 2), but not to annual sums made payable in policies of insurance
(§ 6). Apportionment under the act can be excluded by express
stipulation.</p>

<p>The apportionment created by this statute is &ldquo;apportionment
in respect of time.&rdquo; The cases to which it applies are mainly
cases of either (A) apportionment of rent due under leases where
at a time between the dates fixed for payment the lessor or lessee
dies, or some other alteration in the position of parties occurs;
or (B) apportionment of income between the representatives of a
limited owner and the remainder-man when the limited interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
determines at a time between the date when such income became
due.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(A) With regard to the former of these classes, it may be noticed
that although apportioned rent becomes payable only when the
whole rent is due, the landlord, in the case of the bankruptcy of an
ordinary tenant, may prove for a proportionate part of the rent up
to the date of the receiving order (Bankruptcy Act 1883, Sched. ii.
r. 19); and that a similar rule holds good in the winding up of a
company (<i>in re South Kensington Co-operative Stores</i>, 1881, 17
Ch.D. 161); and further that the act of 1870 applies to the liability
to pay, as well as to the right to receive, rent (<i>in re Wilson</i>, 1893,
62 L.J.Q.B. 628, 632). Accordingly where an assignment of a
lease is made between two half-yearly rent-days, the assignee is not
liable to pay the full amount of the half-year&rsquo;s rent falling due on the
rent-day next after the date of the assignment, but only an apportioned
part of that half-year&rsquo;s rent, computed from the last mentioned
date (<i>Glass</i> v. <i>Patterson</i>, 1902, 2 Ir.R. 660).</p>

<p>(B.) With regard to the apportionment of income, the only points
requiring notice here are that all dividends payable by public
companies are apportionable, whether paid at fixed periods or not,
unless the payment is, in effect, a payment of capital (§ 5).</p>
</div>

<p>The Apportionment Act 1870 extends to Scotland and Ireland.
It has been followed in many of the British colonies (<i>e.g.</i> Ontario,
Rev. Stats., 1897, c. 170, §§ 4-8; New Zealand, No. 4 of 1886;
Tasmania, No. 8 of 1871; Barbados, No. 12 of 1891, §§ 9-12).
Similar legislation has been adopted in many of the states of the
American Union, where, as in England, rent was not, at common
law, apportionable as to time (Kent, <i>Comm</i>. iii. 469-472).</p>

<p>An <i>equitable apportionment</i>, apart from statute law, arises where
property is bequeathed on trust to pay the income to a tenant
for life and the reversion to others, and the realization of the
property in the form of a fund capable of producing income is
postponed for the benefit of the estate. In such cases there is an
ultimate apportionment between the persons entitled to the
income and those entitled to the capital of the accumulations
for the period of such postponement. The rule followed is this:
the proceeds, when realized, are apportionable between capital
and income by ascertaining the sum which, put out and accumulated
at 3% <i>per annum</i> from the day of the testator&rsquo;s death
(with yearly rents and deducting income tax) would have produced
at the day of receipt the sum actually received. The sum
so ascertained should be treated as capital and the residue as
income. (<i>In re Earl of Chesterfield&rsquo;s Trusts</i>, 1883, 24 Ch.D.
643; <i>In re Goodenough</i>, 1895, 2 Ch. 537; <i>Rowlls</i> v. <i>Bebb</i>, 1900,
2 Ch. 107.)</p>

<p>The same term is applied to the acts passed by the state
legislatures for correcting and redistributing the representation
of the counties. Such acts are usually passed at decennial
intervals, more often after the federal census, but the dates may
vary in different states. The state representatives are usually
apportioned among the several counties according to population
and not by geographical position. The electoral districts so
formed are expected to be equal in proportion to the number of
inhabitants; but this method has led to much abuse in the past,
through the making of unequal districts for partisan purposes.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gerrymander</a></span>.)</p>

<p>If a state has received an increase in the number of its representatives
and its legislature does not pass an apportionment
bill before the next congressional election, the votes of the whole
state elect the additional members on a general ticket and they
are called &ldquo;congressmen-at-large.&rdquo;</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APPRAISER<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>appretiare</i>, to value), one who sets a
value upon property, real or personal. In England the business
of an appraiser is usually combined with that of an auctioneer,
while the word itself has given place, to a great extent, to that of
&ldquo;valuer.&rdquo; (See the articles <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Auctions and Auctioneers</a></span>, and
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Valuation and Valuers</a></span>.)</p>

<p>In the United States appraiser is a term often used to describe
a person specially appointed by a judicial or quasi-judicial
authority to put a valuation on property, <i>e.g.</i> on the items of an
inventory of the estate of a deceased person or on land taken
for public purposes by the right of eminent domain. Appraisers
of imported goods and boards of general appraisers have extensive
functions in administering the customs laws of the
United States. Merchant appraisers are sometimes appointed
temporarily under the revenue laws to value where there is no
resident appraiser without holding the office of appraiser (U.S.
Rev. Stats. § 2609).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APPREHENSION<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (Lat. <i>ad</i>, to; <i>prehendere</i>, to seize), in
psychology, a term applied to a mode of consciousness in
which nothing is affirmed or denied of the object in question, but
the mind is merely aware of (&ldquo;seizes&rdquo;) it. &ldquo;Judgment&rdquo; (says
Reid, ed. Hamilton, i. p. 414) &ldquo;is an act of the mind specifically
different from simple apprehension or the bare conception
of a thing&rdquo;; and again, &ldquo;Simple apprehension or conception
can neither be true nor false.&rdquo; This distinction provides for the
large class of mental acts in which we are simply aware of or
&ldquo;take in&rdquo; a number of familiar objects, about which we in
general make no judgment unless our attention is suddenly
called by a new feature. Or again two alternatives may be
apprehended without any resultant judgment as to their respective
merits. Similarly G.F. Stout points out that while
we have a very vivid idea of a character or an incident in a work
of fiction, we can hardly be said in any real sense to have any
belief or to make any judgment as to its
existence or truth. With this mental state
may be compared the purely aesthetic contemplation
of music, wherein apart from, say,
a false note, the faculty of judgment is for
the time inoperative. To these examples may
be added the fact that one can fully understand
an argument in all its bearings without in any
way judging its validity.</p>

<p>Without going into the question fully, it
may be pointed out that the distinction
between judgment and apprehension is relative.
In every kind of thought there is judgment of
some sort in a greater or less degree of
prominence. Judgment and thought are in
fact psychologically distinguishable merely as
different, though correlative, activities of consciousness.
Professor Stout further investigates the phenomena
of apprehension, and comes to the conclusion that &ldquo;it is possible
to distinguish and identify a whole without apprehending any of
its constituent details.&rdquo; On the other hand, if the attention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>
focuses itself for a time on the apprehended object, there is
an expectation that such details will as it were emerge into
consciousness. Hence he describes such apprehension as
&ldquo;implicit,&rdquo; and in so far as the implicit apprehension determines
the order of such emergence he describes it as &ldquo;schematic.&rdquo;
A good example of this process is the use of formulae in calculations;
ordinarily the formula is used without question; if
attention is fixed upon it, the steps by which it is shown to be
universally applicable emerge and the &ldquo;schema&rdquo; is complete
in detail.</p>

<p>With this result may be compared Kant&rsquo;s theory of apprehension
as a synthetic act (the &ldquo;synthesis of apprehension&rdquo;)
by which the sensory elements of a perception are subjected
to the formal conditions of time and space.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APPRENTICESHIP<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (from Fr. <i>apprendre</i>, to learn), a contract
whereby one person, called the master, binds himself to teach,
and another, called the apprentice, undertakes to learn, some
trade or profession, the apprentice serving his master for a certain
time.</p>

<p>Roman law is silent on the subject on this contract, nor does
it seem to have had any connexion with the division of the Roman
citizens into tribes or colleges. So far as can be seen it arose in
the middle ages, and formed an integral part of the system of
trade gilds and corporations by which skilled labourers of all
kinds sought protection against the feudal lords, and the maintenance
of those exclusive privileges with which in the interests
of the public they were favoured. In those times it was believed
that neither arts nor sciences would flourish unless such only
were allowed to practise them as had given proofs of reasonable
proficiency and were formed into bodies corporate, with certain
powers of self-government and the exclusive monopoly of their
respective arts within certain localities; and the medieval
<i>universitas</i> (corporation)&mdash;whether of smiths and tailors or of
scholars&mdash;included both such as were entitled to practise and
teach and such as were in course of learning. The former were
the masters, the latter the apprentices. Hence the term <i>apprentice</i>
was applied indifferently to such as were being taught a
trade or a learned profession, and even to undergraduates or
scholars who were qualifying themselves for the degree of doctor
or master in the liberal arts. When barristers were first appointed
by Edward I. of England they were styled <i>apprenticii
ad legem</i>&mdash;the serjeants-at-law being <i>servientes ad legem</i>; and
these two terms corresponded respectively to the trade names
of apprentices and journeymen. During the middle ages the
term of apprenticeship was seven years, and this period was
thought no more than sufficient to instruct the learner in his
profession, craft or mystery under a properly qualified master,
teacher or doctor&mdash;for these names were synonymous&mdash;and
to reimburse the latter by service for the training received.
After this the apprentice became himself a master and a member
of the corporation, with full rights to practise the business
and to teach others in his turn; so also it would seem that
undergraduates had to pass through a curriculum of seven years
before they could attain the degree of doctor or master in the
liberal arts. On the continent of Europe these rules were observed
with considerable rigour, both in the learned professions
and in those which we now designate as trades. In England
they made their way more slowly and did not receive much
countenance, there being always a jealousy of anything savouring
of interference with the freedom of trade. Nevertheless the
formation of gilds and companies of tradesmen in England dates
probably from the 12th century, and the institution of apprenticeships
cannot be of much later date. In 1388 and 1405 it is
noticed in acts of parliament. By various subsequent statutes
provisions were made for the regulation of the institution,
and from them it appears that seven years was its ordinary
and normal term in the absence of special arrangement. By a
statute of 1562 this was made the law of the land, and it was
enacted that no person should exercise any &ldquo;trade or mystery&rdquo;
without having served a seven years&rsquo; apprenticeship. In no
place did the apprentices become so formidable by their numbers
and organization as in London. During the Great Rebellion
they took an active part as a political body, and were conspicuous
after the Restoration by being frequently engaged in tumults.
It was probably owing to this circumstance, quite as much as to
economic considerations of freedom of trade, that the act of
Elizabeth never found much favour with the courts of law. Soon
after the Great Rebellion we find the apprentice laws strongly
reprobated by the judges, who endeavoured, on the theory that
the act of Elizabeth could apply to no trades which were not in
existence at its date, to limit its operation as far as possible.
Such limitation of the act gave rise to many absurd anomalies
and inconsistencies, <i>e.g.</i> that a coachmaker could not make his
own wheels but must buy them of a wheelwright, while the
latter might make both wheels and coaches, because coach-making
was not a trade in England when the act of Elizabeth
was passed. For the like reason the great textile and metal
manufactures which arose at Manchester and Birmingham
were held exempt from the operation of the statute. Concurrently
with the dislike to the apprentice laws which such
anomalies generated, the doctrines of Adam Smith, that all
monopolies or restrictions on the freedom of trade were injurious
to the public interest, had gradually been making their
way, and notwithstanding much opposition an act was passed in
1814 by which the statute of Elizabeth, in so far as it enacts
that no person shall engage in any trade without a seven years&rsquo;
apprenticeship, was wholly repealed. The effect of this act was
to give every person the fullest right to exercise any occupation
or calling of a mechanical or trading kind for which he deemed
himself qualified.</p>

<p>Apprenticeship, therefore, which was formerly a compulsory,
now became a voluntary contract. In the case of the learned
professions the principles and theories which gave birth to
corporations with monopolies, and required apprenticeship or its
equivalents, have&mdash;contrary to what has taken place in trade&mdash;
been not only maintained but intensified; that is to say, not
only have such bodies retained and even extended in some cases
their exclusive privileges, but in general no one is allowed to
practise in such professions unless his capabilities have been
tested and approved by public authority. Thus no man is
allowed to practise law or medicine in any of their branches who
has not undergone the appropriate training by attendance at a
university or by apprenticeship&mdash;sometimes by both combined&mdash;
and passed certain examinations. Entrance to the church is
guarded by similar checks. In such instances the old principle&mdash;
now generally abandoned in trade&mdash;of granting a monopoly to
those possessing a certain standard of qualification is maintained
in greater vigour than ever.</p>

<p>In some kinds of manufacture the old conditions have been
modified by the subdivisions of labour or by the introduction of
machinery, which have reduced the amount of skill which
formerly was requisite, and thus they have passed out of the
category of the higher skilled handicrafts, as only a very slight
or short training is necessary to make an efficient worker; but
a large number of the higher skilled trades remain which require a
long period of training at the bench, and a careful inquiry into
this subject has shown that in nearly all of such trades there is
a scarcity of skilled workers, which is due to the falling off in the
number of apprenticeships. Many persons qualified to form an
opinion deplore that something in the nature of the old standard
of qualification is not still applied to those trades, and consider
that the only method of restoring a high standard of skill is by
apprenticeship. The decay of apprenticeship in these trades is
due, not to any inherent defect in the system, nor to its having
been superseded by any other form of technical education, but to
difficulties, especially in London and some other large towns,
which place it beyond the reach of that class of persons who have
the greatest need of it. Among these difficulties are:&mdash;first,
insufficient organization, and secondly, want of funds to pay
premiums where such are required. These difficulties are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
accentuated in London and some other large towns, but in many
other districts apprenticeship is actively proceeded with.
Efforts are being made, notably by the National Institution of
Apprenticeship, to meet these difficulties. The Charity Commissioners
in their report for 1905 recognized the value of this
institution, and stated that they would in future enable the
trustees of charity endowments for apprenticeship to avail
themselves of the practical co-operation of the institution. The
modern trade unions, on the other hand, have done nothing to
assist in restoring apprenticeship to its proper place; on the
contrary, they have hampered it by restrictions which they have
imposed, limiting the number of apprentices who may be taken.
The result of fewer apprentices has been not only to lower the
standard of skill in the higher trades, but to reduce the productive
capacity of the artisans. The altered conditions now attending
apprenticeship are, mainly, that the apprentice does not live
with the master, and that the term is generally five years instead
of a longer period; but the principle remains precisely the same,
and the fact that it is applied more and more largely in Austria,
Germany and other countries is an evidence of its necessity.</p>

<p>The contract of apprenticeship is generally created by indenture,
but any writing properly expressed and attested will do.
The full consideration must be set out, and the instrument,
whether a premium is paid or not, must be duly stamped, except
in the case of parish apprentices and apprentices to the sea
service (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Seamen, Laws Relating to</a></span>). Where a charity or
institution intervenes, it retains control over the indentures
until the end of the term of apprenticeship, when the indenture
should be cancelled and given up to the apprentice. Any one who
is capable of making a contract can take an apprentice, and the
law does not limit the number which may be taken by any master.
Any person of legal capacity can bind himself as an apprentice,
provided he is over seven years of age, though, as he is by the
common law exempt from all liability <i>ex contractu</i>, it is usual for
the apprentice&rsquo;s relations or friends to become bound for his
service and good conduct during the period of his apprenticeship.
The consent of the apprentice, however, must be expressed by
his executing the indenture. No child under nine can be bound
as a parish apprentice. The master must teach the apprentice
the agreed trade or trades; should the master exercise two
trades (which he has agreed to teach) and give up one, it would
be good ground for dissolving the contract by the apprentice.
An apprentice is not bound to work on Sundays, but he may be
required to work on bank holidays. He cannot become a volunteer
(soldier) without his master&rsquo;s consent. It is usual in the
indenture to state whether the apprentice is to be paid wages or
otherwise. If the contract is to pay wages, no deduction can be
made owing to illness or accident, unless it has been so provided
for in the indentures. Nor is the apprentice liable for breakages
or similar faults. The master has been supposed to have a right
to administer moderate corporal punishment, though he may not
delegate it. But this right is really obsolete. According to
old custom a master provided proper food for his apprentices,
and medical attendance when required; but the modern practice
is for apprentices to reside with their parents or friends who
maintain them. A master cannot assign indentures without the
approval of the apprentice or such parties as are named in the
contract for this purpose, even if he should transfer his business.
The contract of apprenticeship may be dissolved by (1) efflux of
time; (2) by death (if the master dies, some part of the premium
is usually returnable, but if the apprentice dies no part is returnable);
(3) by consent; (4) in case of grave misconduct; (5) under
the Bankruptcy Act 1883, providing for discharge of the indentures
of apprenticeship and for payment on account of
premium. Disputes between master and apprentice, in cases
where no premium has been paid, or where the premium does not
exceed £25, are dealt with by courts of summary jurisdiction.
Apprentices bound according to the &ldquo;custom of London,&rdquo; who
are infants above the age of fourteen years and under twenty-one
and unmarried, are responsible upon covenants contained in
indentures executed by them just as if they were of full age.
The term of apprenticeship is usually not less than four years.
Apprentices by the custom of London in agreements made at
the Guildhall are subject to the jurisdiction of the chamberlain
of London.</p>

<p>Parish apprentices are those bound out by guardians of the
poor in England. By the Poor Relief Act 1601, overseers of the
poor were empowered, with the consent of two justices, to put out
poor children as apprentices &ldquo;where they shall be convenient.&rdquo;
Owing to the disinclination to receive such apprentices it became
necessary to make the reception compulsory (1696), but this
compulsion to receive them was abolished in 1844. Many
statutes have been passed from time to time regulating the
apprenticing of parish children, but it is now under the control
of the Local Government Board, which issues rules specifying
fully the manner in which such children are to be bound, assigned
and maintained.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APPROPRIATION<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>appropriare</i>, to set aside), the act
of setting apart and applying to a particular use to the exclusion
of all other. In ecclesiastical law, appropriation is the perpetual
annexation of an ecclesiastical benefice to the use of some spiritual
corporation, either aggregate or sole. In the middle ages in
England the custom grew up of the monasteries reserving to
their own use the greater part of the tithes of their appropriated
benefices, leaving only a small portion to their vicars in the
parishes. On the dissolution of the monasteries these &ldquo;great
tithes&rdquo; were often granted, with the monastic lands, to laymen,
whose successors, known as &ldquo;lay impropriators&rdquo; or &ldquo;lay rectors,&rdquo;
still hold them, the system being known as <i>impropriation</i>. Appropriation
may be severed and the church become disappropriate,
by the presentation of a clerk, properly instituted and inducted,
or by the dissolution of the corporation possessing the benefice.</p>

<p>In the law of debtor and creditor, appropriation of payments is
the application of a particular payment for the purpose of paying
a particular debt. When a creditor has two debts due to him
from the same debtor on distinct accounts, the general law as to
the appropriation of payments made by the debtor is that the
debtor is entitled to apply the payments to such account as he
thinks fit; <i>solvitur in modum solventis</i>. In default of appropriation
by the debtor the creditor is entitled to determine the
application of the sums paid, and may appropriate them even
to the discharge of debts barred by the Statute of Limitations.
In default of appropriation by either debtor or creditor, the law
implies an appropriation of the earlier payments to the earlier
debts.</p>

<p>In constitutional law, appropriation is the assignment of money
for a special purpose. In the United Kingdom an Appropriation
Bill is a bill passed at the end of each session of parliament,
enumerating the money grants made during the session, and
appropriating the various sums, as voted by committee of supply,
to the various purposes for which it is to be applied. The
United States constitution (art. I. § 9) says: &ldquo;No money shall
be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations
made by law.&rdquo; Bills for appropriating money originate in the
House of Representatives, but may be amended in the Senate.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APRAKSIN, THEDOR MATVYEEVICH<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (1671-1728), Russian
soldier, began life as one of the pages of Tsar Theodore III., after
whose death he served the little tsar Peter in the same capacity.
The playfellowship of the two lads resulted in a lifelong friendship.
In his twenty-first year Apraksin was appointed governor of
Archangel, then the most important commercially of all the
Russian provinces, and built ships capable of weathering storms,
to the great delight of the tsar. He won his colonelcy at the siege
of Azov (1696). In 1700 he was appointed chief of the admiralty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230</span>
in which post (from 1700 to 1706) his unusual technical ability
was of great service. While Peter was combating Charles XII.,
Apraksin was constructing fleets, building fortresses and havens
(Taganrog). In 1707 he was transferred to Moscow. In 1708 he
was appointed commander-in-chief in Ingria, to defend the new
capital against the Swedes, whom he utterly routed, besides
capturing Viborg in Carelia. He held the chief command in the
Black Sea during the campaign of the Pruth (1711), and in 1713
materially assisted the conquest of Finland by his operations
from the side of the sea. In 1710-1720 he personally conducted
the descents upon Sweden, ravaging that country mercilessly,
and thus extorting the peace of Nystad, whereby she surrendered
the best part of her Baltic provinces to Russia. For these great
services he was made a senator and admiral-general of the empire.
His last expedition was to Reval in 1726, to cover the town from
an anticipated attack by the English government, with whom the
relations of Russia at the beginning of the reign of Catharine I.
were strained almost to breaking-point. Though frequently
threatened with terrible penalties by Peter the Great for his
incurable vice of peculation, Apraksin, nevertheless, contrived to
save his head, though not his pocket, chiefly through the mediation
of the good-natured empress, Catharine, who remained his
friend to the last, and whom he assisted to place on the throne on
the death of Peter. Apraksin was the most genial and kind-hearted
of all Peter&rsquo;s pupils. He is said to have never made an
enemy. He died on the 10th of November 1728.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APRICOT<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> (from the Lat. <i>praecox</i>, or <i>praecoquus</i>, ripened
early, <i>coquere</i>, to cook, or ripen; the English form, formerly
&ldquo;apricock&rdquo; and &ldquo;abrecox,&rdquo; comes through the Fr. <i>abricot</i>,
from the Span. <i>albaricoque</i>, which was an adaptation of the
Arabic <i>al-burquk</i>, itself a rendering of the late Gr. <span class="grk" title="prekokkia">&#960;&#961;&#949;&#954;&#972;&#954;&#954;&#953;&#945;</span> or
<span class="grk" title="praikokion">&#960;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#954;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, adapted from the Latin; the derivation from <i>in
aprico cactus</i> is a mere guess), the fruit of <i>Prunus armeniaca</i>, also
called <i>Armeniaca vulgaris</i>. Under the former name it is regarded
as a species of the genus to which the plums belong, the latter
establishes it as a distinct genus of the natural order <i>Rosaceae</i>.
The apricot is, like the plum, a stone fruit, cultivated generally
throughout temperate regions, and used chiefly in the form of
preserves and in tarts. The tree has long been cultivated in
<i>Armenia</i> (hence the name <i>Armeniaca</i>); it is a native of north
China and other parts of temperate Asia. It flowers very early in
the season, and is a hardy tree, but the fruit will scarcely ripen in
Britain unless the tree is trained against a wall. A great number
of varieties of the apricot, as of most cultivated fruits, are
distinguished by cultivators. The kernels of several varieties
are edible, and in Egypt those of the Musch-Musch variety form
a considerable article of commerce. The French liqueur <i>Eau de
noyaux</i> is prepared from bitter apricot kernels. Large quantities
of fruit are imported from France into the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The apricot is propagated by budding on the mussel or common
plum stock. The tree succeeds in good well-drained loamy soil,
rather light than heavy. It is usually grown as a wall tree, the
east and west aspects being preferred to the south, which induces
mealiness in the fruit, though in Scotland the best aspects are
necessary. The most usual and best mode of training is the fan
method. The fruit is produced on shoots of the preceding year,
and on small close spurs formed on the two-year-old wood. The
trees should be planted about 20 ft. apart. The summer pruning
should begin early in June, at which period all the irregular foreright
and useless shoots are pinched off; and, shortly afterwards,
those which remain are fastened to the wall. At the winter
pruning all branches not duly furnished with spurs and fruit buds
are removed. The young bearing shoots are moderately pruned
at the points, care being, however, taken to leave a terminal shoot
or leader to each branch. The most common error in the pruning
of apricots is laying in the bearing shoots too thickly; the
branches naturally diverge in fan training, and when they extend
so as to be about 15 in. apart, a fresh branch should be laid in,
to be again subdivided as required. The blossoms of the apricot
open early in spring, but are more hardy than those of the
peach; the same means of protection when necessary may be
employed for both. If the fruit sets too numerously, it is thinned
out in June and in the beginning of July, the later thinnings being
used for tarts. In the south of England, where the soil is suitable,
the hardier sorts of apricot, as the Breda and Brussels, bear well
as standard trees in favourable seasons. In such cases the trees
may be planted from 20 to 25 ft. apart.</p>

<p>The ripening of the fruit of the apricot is accelerated by
culture under glass, the trees being either planted out like
peaches or grown in pots on the orchard-house system. They
must be very gently excited, since they naturally bloom when the
spring temperature is comparatively low. At first a maximum of
40° only must be permitted; after two or three weeks it may be
raised to 45°, and later on to 50° and 55°, and thus continued
till the trees are in flower, air being freely admitted, and the
minimum or night temperature ranging from 40° to 45°. After
the fruit is set the temperature should be gradually raised, being
kept higher in clear weather than in dull. When the fruit has
stoned, the temperature may be raised to 60° or 65° by day and
60° by night; and for ripening off it may be allowed to reach 70°
or 80° by sun heat.</p>

<p>The Moorpark is one of the best and most useful sorts in cultivation,
and should be planted for all general purposes; the Peach
is a very similar variety, not quite identical; and the Hemskerk
is also similar, but hardier. The Large Early, which ripens in
the end of July and beginning of August, and the Kaisha, a
sweet-kernelled variety, which ripens in the middle of August,
are also to be recommended. For standard trees in favourable
localities the Breda and Brussels may be added.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APRIL,<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> the second month of the ancient Roman, and the
fourth of the modern calendar, containing thirty days. The
derivation of the name is uncertain. The traditional etymology
from Lat. <i>aperire</i>, &ldquo;to open,&rdquo; in allusion to its being the season
when trees and flowers begin to &ldquo;open,&rdquo; is supported by
comparison with the modern Greek use of <span class="grk" title="anoixis">&#7941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#958;&#953;&#962;</span> (opening) for
spring. This seems very possible, though, as all the Roman
months were named in honour of divinities, and as April was
sacred to Venus, the <i>Festum Veneris et Fortunae Virilis</i> being
held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was
originally her month Aphrilis, from her Greek name Aphrodite.
Jacob Grimm suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero,
<i>Aper</i> or <i>Aprus</i>. On the fourth and the five following days,
games (<i>Ludi Megalenses</i>) were celebrated in honour of Cybele;
on the fifth there was the <i>Festum Fortunae Publicae</i>; on the
tenth (?) games in the circus, and on the nineteenth equestrian
combats, in honour of Ceres; on the twenty-first&mdash;which was
regarded as the birthday of Rome&mdash;the <i>Vinalia urbana</i>, when
the wine of the previous autumn was first tasted; on the twenty-fifth,
the <i>Robigalia</i>, for the averting of mildew; and on the
twenty-eighth and four following days, the riotous <i>Floralia</i>.
The Anglo-Saxons called April <i>Oster-monath</i> or <i>Eostur-monath</i>,
the period sacred to <i>Eostre</i> or <i>Ostara</i>, the pagan Saxon goddess
of spring, from whose name is derived the modern Easter.
St George&rsquo;s day is the twenty-third of the month; and St Mark&rsquo;s
Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are
doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church,
falls on the twenty-fourth. In China the symbolical ploughing
of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood takes place
in their third month, which frequently corresponds to our
April; and in Japan the feast of Dolls is celebrated in the same
month. The &ldquo;days of April&rdquo; (<i>journées d&rsquo;avril</i>) is a name
appropriated in French history to a series of insurrections at
Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of Louis
Philippe in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and
to a famous trial known as the <i>procès d&rsquo;avril</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APRIL-FOOLS&rsquo; DAY,<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> or <span class="sc">All-Fools&rsquo; Day</span>, the name given
to the 1st of April in allusion to the custom of playing practical
jokes on friends and neighbours on that day, or sending them
on fools&rsquo; errands. The origin of this custom has been much
disputed, and many ludicrous solutions have been suggested,
<i>e.g.</i> that it is a farcical commemoration of Christ being sent
from Annas to Caiaphas, from Caiaphas to Pilate, from Pilate
to Herod, and from Herod back again to Pilate, the crucifixion
having taken place about the 1st of April. What seems certain
is that it is in some way or other a relic of those once universal
festivities held at the vernal equinox, which, beginning on old
New Year&rsquo;s day, the 25th of March, ended on the 1st of April.
This view gains support from the fact that the exact counterpart
of April-fooling is found to have been an immemorial custom
in India. The festival of the spring equinox is there termed
the feast of Huli, the last day of which is the 31st of March, upon
which the chief amusement is the befooling of people by sending
them on fruitless errands. It has been plausibly suggested that
Europe derived its April-fooling from the French. They were
the first nation to adopt the reformed calendar, Charles IX.
in 1564 decreeing that the year should begin with the 1st of
January. Thus the New Year&rsquo;s gifts and visits of felicitation
which had been the feature of the 1st of April became associated
with the first day of January, and those who disliked the change
were fair butts for those wits who amused themselves by sending
mock presents and paying calls of pretended ceremony on the
1st of April. Though the 1st of April appears to have been
anciently observed in Great Britain as a general festival, it was
apparently not until the beginning of the 18th century that
the making of April-fools was a common custom. In Scotland
the custom was known as &ldquo;hunting the gowk,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the cuckoo,
and April-fools were &ldquo;April-gowks,&rdquo; the cuckoo being there,
as it is in most lands, a term of contempt. In France the person
befooled is known as <i>poisson d&rsquo;avril</i>. This has been explained
from the association of ideas arising from the fact that in April
the sun quits the zodiacal sign of the fish. A far more natural
explanation would seem to be that the April fish would be a
young fish and therefore easily caught.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">A PRIORI<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> (Lat. <i>a</i>, from, <i>prior, prius</i>, that which is before,
precedes), (1) a phrase used popularly of a judgment based on
general considerations in the absence of particular evidence;
(2) a logical term first used, apparently, by Albert of Saxony
(14th century), though the theory which it denotes is as old as
Aristotle. In the order of human knowledge the particular
facts of experience come first and are the basis of generalized
laws or causes (the Scholastic <i>notiora nobis</i>); but in the order
of nature the latter rank first as the self-existent, fundamental
truths of existence (<i>notiora naturae</i>). Thus to Aristotle the
<i>a priori</i> argument is from law or cause to effect, as opposed to
what we call <i>a posteriori</i> (<i>posterior</i>, subsequent, derived), from
effect to cause. Since Kant the two phrases have become purely
adjectival (instead of adverbial) with a technical controversial
sense, closely allied to the Aristotelian, in relation to knowledge
and judgments generally. <i>A priori</i> is applied to judgments
which are regarded as independent of experience, and belonging
to the essence of thought; <i>a posteriori</i> to those which are derived
from particular observations. The distinction is analogous to
that between analysis and synthesis, deduction and induction
(but there may be a synthesis of <i>a priori</i> judgments, cf. Kant&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Synthetic Judgment <i>a priori</i>&rdquo;). Round this distinction
a rather barren controversy has raged, and almost all modern
philosophers have labelled themselves either &ldquo;Intuitionalist&rdquo;
(<i>a priori</i>) or &ldquo;Empiricist&rdquo; (<i>a posteriori</i>) according to the view
they take of knowledge. In fact, however, the rival schools
are generally arguing at cross purposes; there is a knowledge
based on particulars, and also a knowledge of laws or causes.
But the two work in different spheres, and are complementary.
The observation of isolated particulars gives not necessity, but
merely strong probability; necessity is purely intellectual or
&ldquo;transcendental.&rdquo; If the empiricist denies the intellectual
element in scientific knowledge, he must not claim absolute
validity for his conclusions; but he may hold against the
intuitionalist that absolute laws are impossible to the human
intellect. On the other hand, pure <i>a priori</i> knowledge can be
nothing more than form without content (<i>e.g.</i> formal logic, the
laws of thought). The simple fact at the bottom of the controversy
is that in all empirical knowledge there is an intellectual
element, without which there is no correlation of empirical data,
and every judgment, however simple, postulates a correlation
of some sort if only that between the predicate and its contradictory.</p>

a hemispherical vault. The term is applied also to the termination
to the choir, transept or aisle of any church which is either
semicircular or polygonal in plan, whether vaulted or covered
with a timber roof; a church is said to be &ldquo;apsidal&rdquo; when it
terminates in an apse.</p>

<p>The earliest example of an apse is found in the temple of
Mars Ultor at Rome (2 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and it formed afterwards the
favourite feature terminating the rear of any temple, and one
which gave importance to the statue of the deity to whom the
temple was dedicated. Its use by the Romans was not confined
to the temples, as it is found in the palaces on the Palatine Hill,
the great Thermae (Baths) and other monuments. In the civil
basilicas the apse was screened off by columns, and constituted
the court of justice. In the Ulpian (Trajan&rsquo;s) Basilica the apses
at each end were of such great dimensions as to come better
under the definition of hemicycles (<i>q.v.</i>). In these apses the
floor was raised, and had an altar placed in the centre of its
chord, where sacrifices were made prior to the sittings. The
only other two Roman basilicas in which the semicircular apse
can still be traced are that commenced by Maxentius and
completed by Constantine at Rome and the basilica at Trier
(Trèves).</p>

or crypt, was placed at the west end of the church. This orientation
was originally followed in the churches of St Paul and
St Lawrence (S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura), both outside the walls
of Rome, and is found in most of the churches at Rome. On
the other hand, in the Byzantine church, the apse was built at the
east end of the church.</p>

<p>During the reign of Justin the Second (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 565-574), owing
to a change in the liturgy, two more apses were added, one on
each side of the central apse. These in the Greek Church were
provided not to hold altars but for ceremonial purposes. One of
the earliest examples is found in the church of St Nicholas at
Myra of the 6th century, and the basilica erected in the great
court of the temple at Baalbek shows the triple apse. The
earliest example in Rome is found in the church of Sta Maria
in Cosmedin (772-795), built probably by Greek craftsmen, who
had been exiled by the Iconoclasts. Other triapsal choirs are
found in the cathedral of Parenzo (542 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>), in St Mark&rsquo;s,
Venice, in Sta Fosca and the Duomo at Torcello, and in numerous
examples throughout Italy and Germany. In central Syria
there is one example only, at Kalat Seman, where the side apses
were a later addition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span></p>

<p>There is one important distinction to be drawn between the
Byzantine and the Latin apses; they are both semicircular
internally, but externally the former are nearly always polygonal.
It follows, therefore, that in those churches in Italy
where the apse is polygonal externally, it is a sign of direct
Byzantine influence. This is found in St Mark&rsquo;s, Venice;
Sta Fosca, Torcello; Murano; nearly all the churches at
Ravenna; and in the Crusaders&rsquo; churches throughout Syria.</p>

<p>In the Coptic church in Egypt we find other characteristics;
in the churches of the Red and White Monasteries, attributed
to St Helena, an unusual
depth is given to the apse,
in the walls of which
niches are sunk; in the
church of St John at
Antinoë there are no fewer
than seven. Similar
niches are found in the
apses of St Mark&rsquo;s,
Venice, built in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 828,
it is said in imitation of
St Mark&rsquo;s in Alexandria,
to receive the relics of St Mark brought over from there.</p>

<p>In a large number of the apses in the Coptic churches the
seats round the apse with the bishop&rsquo;s throne in the centre are
still preserved; of these the best examples are at Abu Sargah,
Al &#8219;Adra and Abu-s-Sifain. Unfortunately there are no remains
of the fittings in the tribunes of the ancient Roman basilicas,
but those in St Peter&rsquo;s at Rome, which were probably copied
from them, are recorded in drawings, there being two or three
rows of stone seats with the papal throne in the centre. It is
possible also that some may still exist in the other early Christian
basilicas at Rome, but there have been so many changes that
it is not possible to trace them. In the cathedral of Parenzo
in Istria (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 532-535), the hemicycle of marble seats for the
clergy with the episcopal chair in the centre still exists. A
similar arrangement is found in the apse of the church of the
6th century attached to the church of St Helena in the island
of Paros, where there are eight steep grades of semicircular
stone seats with the bishop&rsquo;s chair in the centre. The aspect
of the interior of this apse has in consequence very much the
appearance of a Roman theatre. A third example, better known,
exists at Torcello, with six concentric seats rising one above the
other, and in the centre the episcopal chair with a flight of
thirteen steps down in front of it.</p>

<p>In the basilica at Bethlehem, the east end of which was
reconstructed probably in the 5th century, apses of similar
dimensions to the eastern apse were built at the north and south
end of the transept. The same disposition is found in the Coptic
churches of the Red and White Monasteries just referred to,
in the church of St Elias at Salonica (<i>c</i>. 1012), the cathedral of
Echmiadzin in Armenia, at Vatopedi, Mt. Athos, and some other
Byzantine churches. An early example in France exists in the
church of Germigny-des-Prés on the Loire (806; rebuilt 1868),
where the three apses are horseshoe on plan, and the same is
found in the church at Oberzell in the island of Reichenau,
Lake of Constance, except that the eastern apse there is square.
Small examples also are found at Querqueville and at St Wandrille
near Caudebec, both in Normandy, but the finest development
takes place in the church of St Maria im Capitol at Cologne,
where the aisles are carried round both the northern and southern
apses. The same feature exists in the cathedral of Tournai in
Belgium and the churches at Cambrai, Soissons and Valenciennes
(the last destroyed at the Revolution) in France, and also in
the cathedrals of Como and of Pisa in Italy. Without aisles,
there are examples in the churches of the Apostles and of
St Martin at Cologne; St Quirinus at Neuss; at Roermond;
St Cross, Breslau; the cathedral of Bonn; and, at a later date,
in the Marienkirche at Trier; S. Elizabeth at Marburg; the
church of Sta Maria-del-Fiore at Florence; and the cathedral
of Parma.</p>

<p>In consequence of a change made in the orientation of apses
in the 6th or 7th century, others were subsequently added at
the west end of existing churches, and this is considered to have
been the case at Canterbury; but in the German churches
sometimes apses were built from the first at both ends, such as
are shown on the manuscript plan of St Gall, of the 9th century.
Western apses exist at Gernrode; Drübeck; Huyseburg; the
Obermünster of Regensburg; St Godehard in Hildesheim;
the cathedrals of Worms and Trier; the Abbey church of
Laach; the Minster at Bonn; and in St Pietro-in-Grado near
Pisa.</p>

<p>The triapsal churches, to which we have referred, are those
in which the side apses form the termination of the side aisles;
but where there are transepts, the aisles are sometimes not
continued beyond them, and the expansion of the transept
to north and south gives more ample space for apses; of these
there are many examples, as in the Abbey church of Laach in
Germany; at Romsey; Christchurch, Hants; Gloucester,
Ely, Norwich and Canterbury cathedrals, in England; and at
St Georges de Boscherville in France; sometimes there being
space for two apses on each side.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the 13th century in France, the apses
became radiating chapels outside the choir aisle, henceforth
known as the chevet. These radiating chapels would seem to
have been suggested in Norwich and Canterbury cathedrals,
but the feature is essentially a French one and in England
is found only in Westminster Abbey, into which it was introduced
by Henry III., to whom the chevets of Amiens, Beauvais
and Reims were probably well known.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APT,<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> a town of south-eastern France, in the department of
Vaucluse, on the left bank of the Coulon, 41 m. E. of Avignon
by rail. Pop. (1906) 4990. The town was formerly surrounded
by massive ancient walls, but these have now been for the most
part replaced by boulevards; many of its streets are narrow
and irregular. The chief object of interest is the church of
Sainte-Anne (once the cathedral), the building of which was
begun about the year 1056 on the site of a much older edifice,
but not completed until the latter half of the 17th century.
Many Roman remains have been found in and near the town.
A fine bridge, the Pont Julien, spanning the Coulon below the
town, dates from the 2nd or 3rd century. A tribunal of first
instance and a communal college are the chief public institutions.
The chief manufactures are silk, confectionery and earthenware;
and there is besides a considerable trade in fruit, grain and cattle.
Apt was at one time the chief town of the Vulgientes, a Gallic
tribe; it was destroyed by the Romans about 125 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> and
restored by Julius Caesar, who conferred upon it the title <i>Apta

<p>Many wingless insects&mdash;such as lice, fleas and certain earwigs
and cockroaches&mdash;are placed in various orders together
with winged insects to which they show evident relationships.
In such cases the absence of wings must be regarded as
secondary&mdash;due
to a parasitic or other special manner of life. But the
bristle-tails and springtails, which form the modern order
Aptera, are all without any trace of wings, and, on account of
several remarkable archaic
characters which they exhibit,
there is reason for
believing that they are
primitively wingless&mdash;that
they represent an early offshoot
which sprang from
the ancestral stock of the
Hexapoda before organs of
flight had been acquired
by the class.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;In addition
to the complete absence of
wings and of metamorphosis,
the Aptera are
characterized by peculiar
elongate mandibles (figs.
1, <i>Mn</i>.; 2, 4), with toothed
apex and sub-apical grinding
surface, like those of
certain Crustacea; by the
presence between the
mandibles and maxillae of
a pair of appendages
(superlinguae or maxillulae),
fig. 1, <i>Mxl</i>., which
are absent or vestigial in
all other insects; and, in
most genera, by the
presence in the adult of
abdominal appendages used
for locomotion, these latter
varying in number from one
to nine pairs. Among
peculiarities of the internal
organs the segmental
arrangement of the ovaries
in most members of the
order is noteworthy. Many
Aptera are covered with
flattened scales like those
of moths.</p>

<p><i>Classification.</i>&mdash;The
Aptera are divided into
two divergent sub-orders,
the <i>Thysanura</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) or
bristle-tails, and the <i>Collembola</i>
or springtails.</p>

<p><i>Thysanura.</i>&mdash;The bristle-tails
have an abdomen of eleven segments, the tenth usually
carrying a pair of long many-jointed tail-feelers (cerci, fig. 1, x.);
sometimes a median, jointed tail-appendage is also present.
To these feelers the popular name is due. There may also be
abdominal appendages&mdash;in the form of simple unjointed stylets
(fig. 1, ii.-ix.), accompanied by paired eversible sacs, probably
respiratory in function&mdash;on eight (or fewer) other abdominal
segments. The head of a bristle-tail carries a pair of compound
eyes and a pair of elongate many-jointed feelers.</p>

<p>The air-tube system is developed in varying degree in different
bristle-tails, the number of pairs of spiracles being three (<i>Campodea</i>),
nine (<i>Machilis</i>), ten (<i>Lepisma</i>), or eleven (<i>Japyx</i>).</p>

<p>Four families of Thysanura are usually recognized. In the
<i>Machilidae</i> and <i>Lepismidae</i> (these two families are known as
the Ectotrophi) the maxillae are like those of typical biting
insects, and there is a median tail-bristle in addition to the
paired cerci; while in the <i>Campodeidae</i> and <i>Japygidae</i> (which
form the group Entotrophi) the jaws are apparently sunk in the
head, through a deep inpushing at the mouth, and there is no
median tail-bristle. The cerci in <i>Japyx</i> are not, as usual, jointed
feelers, but strong, curved appendages forming a forceps as in
earwigs.</p>

<p><i>Collembola.</i>&mdash;In springtails, or <i>Collembola</i>, the jaws are sunk
into the head, as in the entotrophous Thysanura; the head
carries a pair of feelers with not more than six (usually four)
segments, and there are eight (or fewer) distinct simple eyes on
each side of the head (fig. 2, 1, 2). These are in some genera
like the single elements (<i>ommatidia</i>) of a compound insect eye, in
others like simple ocelli. The abdomen consists of six segments
only. The first of these usually carries a ventral tube, furnished
with paired eversible sacs which assist the insects in walking on
smooth surfaces, and perhaps serve also as organs for breathing.
From the researches of V. Willem it appears that the viscid
fluid which causes the adherence of the ventral tube is secreted
by a pair of glands in the head whose ducts open into a superficial
groove leading from the second maxillae backward to the
tube on the first abdominal segment. The third abdominal
segment usually carries a pair of short appendages whose basal
segments are fused together; this is the &ldquo;catch&rdquo; (fig. 2, 7),
whose function is to hold in place the &ldquo;spring,&rdquo; which is formed
by the fourth pair of abdominal appendages&mdash;also with fused
basal segments. In most Collembola the spring appears to
belong to the fifth abdominal somite, but Willem, by study of
the muscles, has shown that it really belongs to the fourth. The
fused basal segments of the appendages form the &ldquo;manubrium&rdquo;
of the spring, which carries the two &ldquo;dentes&rdquo; (usually elongate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
and flexible), each with a &ldquo;mucro&rdquo; at its tip (fig. 2, 5). The fifth
abdominal segment is the genital, and the sixth the anal somite.</p>

<p>The spring serves the Collembola which possess it as an
efficient leaping-organ (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Springtail</a></span>). But in some genera it
is greatly reduced and in many quite vestigial.</p>

<p>Most springtails are without air-tubes, and breathe through
the general cuticle of the body. But in one family (<i>Sminthuridae</i>)
a spiracle, opening on either side between the head and the
prothorax, leads to a branching system of air-tubes. The
<i>Sminthuridae</i> are further characterized by the globular abdomen,
which shows but little external trace of segmentation, and by the
well-developed spring.</p>

<p>In the <i>Entomobryidae</i> the body is elongate and clearly segmented,
but the dorsal region (tergum) of the prothorax is much
reduced and the head downwardly directed; the spring is well
developed. In the <i>Achorutidae</i> the head is forwardly directed,
the tergum of the prothorax conspicuous, and the spring small or
vestigial.</p>

<p>In many genera of springtails a curious post-antennal organ,
consisting of sensory structures (often complex in form) surrounded
by a firm ring, is to be noticed on the cuticle of the head
between the eyes and the feelers. It may be of use as an organ of
smell. Other sensory organs occur on the third and fourth antennal
segments in the <i>Achorutidae</i> and <i>Entomobryidae</i> (fig. 2, 3).</p>

<p><i>Distribution and Habits.</i>&mdash;The Aptera are probably the most
widely distributed of all insects. Among the bristle-tails we
find the genus <i>Machilis</i>, represented in Europe (including the
Faeroe Islands) and in Chile; while <i>Campodea</i> lives high on the
mountains and in the deepest caves. The springtails have even
a wider distribution. The genus <i>Isotoma</i>, for example, has some
of its numerous species in regions so remote as Alaska, Franz
Josef Land, the Sandwich Islands, the South Orkneys, Graham
Land, Kerguelen and South Victoria Land. As it is unlikely
that these delicate insects could be transported across sea-channels,
their wide and discontinuous range suggests both their
great antiquity and the former existence of continental tracts
over which they may have travelled to their present stations.</p>

<p>Springtails and bristle-tails live in damp concealed places&mdash;under
stones or tree-bark, in moss, and in the decaying vegetable
or animal matter which serves as food for most of them. Some
species, however, eat fresh plant-tissues. A species of bristle-tail
(<i>Machilis maritima</i>) and quite a number of springtails haunt
the sea-coast at or below high-water mark. In such localities
many thousands of individuals may sometimes be found associated
together. The insect fauna of limestone caves both in
Europe and North America is largely composed of Aptera,
especially Collembola.</p>

<p><i>Geological History.</i>&mdash;A supposed Thysanuran from the Silurian
of New Brunswick has been described by G.F. Matthew, and
another genus from the French Carboniferous by C. Brongniart.
Not till the Tertiary do we find remains of Aptera in any quantity,
species both of living and extinct genera being represented in the
amber.</p>

<p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;The embryonic development of several genera
of Aptera, which has been carefully studied, will be more suitably
described in comparison with that of other insects than here (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hexapoda</a></span>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;The modern study of the Aptera may be said to
date from the classical memoirs of T. Tullberg, &ldquo;Sveriges Podurider,&rdquo;
in <i>Kongl. Svensk Vetensk. Akad. Handl.</i> x., 1872, and Sir J.
Lubbock (Lord Avebury), &ldquo;Monograph of the Collembola and
Thysanura,&rdquo; <i>Ray Society</i>, 1873. In these, full references to the
older literature will be found. Subsequently our knowledge of the
Thysanura has been markedly advanced by J.T. Oudemans, <i>Bijdrage
tot de Kennis den Thysanura en Collembola</i> (Amsterdam, 1888);
B. Grassi, who published between 1885 and 1889 a series of memoirs
entitled &ldquo;I progenitori dei Miriapodi e degli Insetti,&rdquo; in the <i>Atti
Accad. di Scienz. Nat. Catania</i>, and the <i>Memor. R. Accad. dei Lincei</i>;
and V. Willem, whose &ldquo;Recherches sur les Collemboles et les Thysanoures,&rdquo;
in <i>Mem. Cour. Acad. Roy. Belgique</i>, lviii., 1900, are
indispensable to the student. In addition to this work of Willem,
valuable anatomical papers on Collembola have been published by
H.J. Hansen (<i>Zool. Anz.</i> xvi., 1893), J.W. Folsom (<i>Bull. Mus.
Comp. Anat. Harv.</i> xxxv., 1899), C. Börner (<i>Zool. Anz.</i> xxiii., 1900),
and K. Absolon (<i>Zool. Anz.</i> xxiii. and xxiv., 1900, 1901), the two
latter writers having paid especial attention to the peculiar post-antennal
and antennal sense-organs of springtails. Absolon has
also written on the Collembola of caves. These writers, with H.
Schött, C. Schäffer and others, have published many systematic
papers on Collembola, as has F. Silvestri on Thysanura. British
species are mentioned in Lubbock&rsquo;s monograph; for recent additions
see G.H. Carpenter and W. Evans (<i>Proc. R. Phys. Soc. Edinb.</i> xiv.,
1899, and xv., 1903).</p>

acquaintance of a rich widow, Aemilia Pudentilla, whom he
subsequently married. The members of her family disapproved
of the marriage, and indicted Apuleius on a charge of having
gained her affections by magical arts. He easily established his
innocence, and his spirited, highly entertaining, but inordinately
long defence (<i>Apologia</i> or <i>De Magia</i>) before the proconsul
Claudius Maximus is our principal authority for his biography.
From allusions in his subsequent writings, and the mention of
him by St. Augustine, we gather that the remainder of his
prosperous life was devoted to literature and philosophy. At
Carthage he was elected provincial priest of the imperial cult, in
which capacity he occupied a prominent position in the provincial
council, had the duty of collecting and managing the funds for
the temples of the cult, and the superintendence of the games
in the amphitheatre. He lectured on philosophy and rhetoric,
like the Greek sophists, apparently with success, since statues
were erected in his honour at Carthage and elsewhere. The
year of his death is not known.</p>

<p>The work on which the fame of Apuleius principally rests has
little claim to originality. The <i>Metamorphoses</i> or <i>Golden Ass</i>
(the latter title seems not to be the author&rsquo;s own, but to have
been bestowed in compliment, just as the <i>Libri Rerum Quotidianarum</i>
of Gaius were called <i>Aurei</i>) was founded on a narrative
in the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Lucius of Patrae, a work extant in the
time of Photius. From Photius&rsquo;s account (impugned, however,
by Wieland and Courier), this book would seem to have consisted
of a collection of marvellous stories, related in an inartistic
fashion, and in perfect good faith. The literary capabilities of
this particular narrative attracted the attention of Apuleius&rsquo;s
contemporary, Lucian, who proceeded to work it up in his own
manner, adhering, as Photius seems to indicate, very closely to
the original, but giving it a comic and satiric turn. Apuleius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
followed this rifacimento, making it, however, the groundwork
of an elaborate romance, interspersed with numerous episodes,
of which the beautiful story of Cupid and Psyche is the most
celebrated, and altering the <i>dénouement</i> to suit the religious
revival of which he was an apostle.</p>

<p>The adventures of the youthful hero in the form of an ass are
much the same in both romances, but in Apuleius he is restored
to human shape by the aid of Isis, into whose mysteries he is
initiated, and finally becomes her priestess. The book is a
remarkable illustration of the contemporary reaction against a
period of scepticism, of the general appetite for miracle and
magic, and of the influx of oriental and Egyptian ideas into the
old theology. It is also composed with a well-marked literary
aim, defined by Kretzschmann as the emulation of the Greek
sophists, and the transplantation of their <i>tours de force</i> into the
Latin language. Nothing, indeed, is more characteristic of
Apuleius than his versatility, unless it be his ostentation and self-confidence
in the display of it. The dignified, the ludicrous, the
voluptuous, the horrible, succeed each other with bewildering
rapidity; fancy and feeling are everywhere apparent, but not
less so affectation, meretricious ornament, and that effort to say
everything finely which prevents anything being said well. The
Latinity has a strong African colouring, and is crammed with
obsolete words, agreeably to the taste of the time. When these
defects are mitigated or overlooked, the <i>Golden Ass</i> will be pronounced
a most successful work, invaluable as an illustration of
ancient manners, and full of entertainment from beginning to
end. The most famous and poetically beautiful portion is the
episode of Cupid and Psyche, adapted from a popular legend of
which traces are found in most fairy mythologies, which explains
the seeming incongruity of its being placed in the mouth of an old
hag. The allegorical purport he has infused into it is his own,
and entirely in the spirit of the Platonic philosophy. Don
Quixote&rsquo;s adventure with the wine-skins, and Gil Blas&rsquo;s captivity
among the robbers, are palpably borrowed from Apuleius; and
several of the humorous episodes, probably current as popular
stories long before his time, reappear in Boccaccio.</p>

<p>Of Apuleius&rsquo;s other writings, the <i>Apology</i> has been already
mentioned. The <i>Florida</i> (probably meaning simply &ldquo;anthology,&rdquo;
without any reference to style) consists of a collection of excerpts
from his declamations, ingenious but highly affected, and in
general perfect examples of the sophistical art of saying nothing
with emphasis. They deal with the most varied subjects, and
are intended to exemplify the author&rsquo;s versatility. The pleasing
little tract <i>On the God of Socrates</i> expounds the Platonic doctrine
of beneficent daemons, an intermediate class between gods and
men. Two books on Plato (<i>De Platone et Ejus Dogmate</i>) treat of
his life, and his physical and ethical philosophy; a third, treating
of logic, is generally considered spurious. The <i>De Mundo</i> is an
adaptation of the <span class="grk" title="Peri kosmou">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#965;</span> wrongly attributed to Aristotle.
Apuleius informs us that he had also composed numerous poems
in almost all possible styles, and several works on natural history,
some in Greek. In the preparation of these he seems to have
attended more closely to actual anatomical research than was
customary with ancient naturalists. Some other works&mdash;dealing
with theology, the properties of herbs, medical remedies and
physiognomy, are wrongly attributed to him.</p>

<p>The character of Apuleius, as delineated by himself, is attractive;
he appears vehement and passionate, but devoid of
rancour; enterprising, munificent, genial and an enthusiast
for the beautiful and good. His vanity and love of display are
conspicuous, but are extenuated by a genuine thirst for knowledge
and a surprising versatility of attainments. He prided
himself on his proficiency in both Greek and Latin. His place in
letters is accidentally more important than his genius strictly
entitles him to hold. He is the only extant example in Latin
literature of an accomplished sophist in the good sense of the
term. The loss of other ancient romances has secured him a
peculiar influence on modern fiction; while his chronological
position in a transitional period renders him at once the evening
star of the Platonic, and the morning star of the Neo-Platonic
philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APULIA<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (sometimes <span class="sc">Appulia</span> in manuscripts but never in
inscriptions), the district inhabited in ancient times by the
Apuli. Strictly a Samnite tribe (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Samnites</a></span>) settled round
Mount Garganus on the east coast of Italy (Strabo vi. 3. 11),
the Apuli mingled with the Iapygian tribes of that part of the
coast (Dauni, Peucetii, Poediculi) who, like the Messapii, had
come from Illyria, so that the name Apulia reached down to the
border of the ancient Calabria. Almost the only monument of
Samnite speech from the district is the famous <i>Tabula Bantina</i>
from Bantia, a small city just inside the Peucetian part of Apulia,
on the Lucanian border. This inscription is one of the latest
and in some ways the most important monument of Oscan,
though showing what appear to be some southern peculiarities
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Osca Lingua</a></span>). Its date is almost certainly between 118
and 90 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and it shows that Latin had not even then spread
over the district (cf. <span class="sc">Lucania</span>). Far older than this are some
coins from Ausculum and Teate (later known as Teanum Apulum),
of which the earliest belong to the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Roman or
Latin colonies were few, Luceria (planted 314 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) in the north
and Brundisium (soon after 268) being the chief. (See R.S.
Conway, <i>Italic Dialects</i>, xxviii.-xxx. pp. 15 f.; and Mommsen&rsquo;s
introduction to the opening sections of <i>C.I.L.</i> ix.)</p>
<div class="author">(R. S. C.)</div>

<p>The wars of the 4th and 3rd centuries <span class="scs">B.C.</span> brought a great
part of the pastures of the Apulian plain into the hands of the
Roman state, and a tax was paid on every head of cattle and
every sheep, at first to the tax farmer and later to the imperial
procurator. It was under the Romans that the system of
migration for the flocks reached its full development, and the
practice is still continued; the sheep-tracks (<i>tratturi</i>), 350 ft.
wide, leading from the mountains of the Abruzzi to the plain
of Apulia date in the main at least from the Roman period, and
are mentioned in inscriptions. The plain, however, which once
served as winter grazing ground for a million sheep, now gives
pasture to about one-half of that number.<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The shepherds,
who were slaves, often gave considerable trouble; we hear that
some 7000 of them, who had made the whole country unsafe,
were condemned to death in 185 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (Livy xxxix. 29). Sheep-farming
on a large scale was no doubt detrimental to the interests
of the towns. We hear of repeated risings, for the last time in
the Social War. Even in the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the then chief town
of Apulia, Teate or Teanum Apulum (see above), suffered in this
way. Luceria subsequently took its place, largely owing to its
military importance; but under the Empire it was succeeded
by Canusium.</p>

<p>The road system of Apulia, which touched all the important
towns, consisted of three main lines, the Via Appia (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Appia,
Via</a></span>), the Via Traiana, and the coast road, running more or less
parallel in an east-south-east direction. The first (the southernmost),
coming east from Beneventum, entered Apulia at the
Pons Aufidi, and ran through Venusia to Tarentum, and thence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
turning north-east, to Brundusium. The second, coming north-east
from Beneventum, turned east at Aecae, and ran through
Herdoniae, Canusium, Butuntum, Barium and Gnathia (Gnatia)
to Brundusium. There was also a short cut from Butuntum to
Gnathia through Caelia, keeping inland. The third parallel
line ran to the north of the Via Traiana, in continuation of the
road along the north-east coast of Picenum and Samnium;
it entered Apulia near Larinum (whence a branch ran south to
Bovianum Undecimanorum), and thence, keeping in the plain
to the south of the Mons Garganus, rejoined the coast at Sipontum,
where it received a branch road from the Via Traiana at
Aecae, passing through Luceria and Arpi. It then passed
through Barduli (where it was joined by a road from Canusium
by way of Cannae) to Barium, where it joined the Via Traiana.
From Barium a road probably ran direct to Caelia, and thence
south-south-east to join the Via Appia some 25 m. north-west
of Tarentum.</p>

<p>Barium was an important harbour, though less so than
Brundusium and Tarentum, which, however, belonged to
Calabria in the Roman sense. Apulia, with Calabria, formed
the second region of Augustus, though we once find Calabria
treated as a part of the third region, Lucania (<i>C.I.L.</i> ix. 2213).
The Hannibalic and later wars had, Strabo tells us, destroyed
the former prosperity of the country; in imperial times we hear
little or nothing of it. Both were governed by a <i>corrector</i> from
the time of Constantine onwards, but in 668 the Lombards
conquered Calabria and Apulia, and it was then that the former
name was transferred to Bruttium, the meaning of the latter
being extended to include Calabria also. In the 10th century
the greater part of this territory was recovered by the Byzantine
emperors, whose governor was called <span class="grk" title="Katapanos">&#922;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#962;</span>, a name which,
under the corrupt form Capitanata, belonged to the province
of Foggia till 1861. It was conquered by the Normans under
William Bras-de-fer, who took the title of <i>comes Apuliae</i> in 1042;
it was raised to a dukedom with Calabria by Robert Guiscard in
1059, and united to the Sicilian monarchy in 1127. Many of the
important towns possess fine Romanesque cathedrals, constructed
under the Normans and the Hohenstaufen rulers. It
shared the subsequent fate of Sicily, becoming a part of the
kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1734, and being united with
Italy in 1861.</p>

<p>Modern Apulia comprises the three provinces of Foggia, Bari
and Lecce (the latter corresponding roughly with the ancient
Calabria, which, however, extended somewhat farther
north inland), and is often known as Le Puglie; it
<span class="sidenote">Modern Apulia.</span>
stretches from Monte Gargano to the south-east extremity
of Italy, with an area of 7376 sq. m.; it is bounded on
the north and east by the Adriatic, on the south-east by the
Gulf of Taranto, on the south by Basilicata and on the west
by Campania and the Abruzzi. The three provinces correspond
to the three natural divisions into which it falls. That of Foggia,
though it has mountains on the west and south-west boundary,
and the Monte Gargano at its north-east extremity, is in the main
a great plain called the Tavoliere (chessboard) di Puglia, with
considerable lagoons on its north and east coast. That of Bari,
east-south-east of Foggia and divided from it by the Ofanto
(Aufidus), the only considerable river of Apulia, 104 m. long, is
a hilly district with a coast strip along which are the majority
of the towns&mdash;the lack of villages is especially noticeable; in the
<i>circondario</i> of Barletta, the north-east portion of the province,
there are only eleven communes, with a total population of
335,934. That of Lecce, to the east-south-east again, is a low
flat limestone terrace.</p>

<p>The industries of Apulia are mainly pastoral or agricultural.
Besides sheep, a considerable number of horses, cattle and swine
are bred; while despite the lack of water, which is the great
need of modern Apulia (in 1906 arrangements were made for
a great aqueduct, to supply the three provinces from the headwaters
of the Sele), cultivation is actively carried on, especially
in the province of Bari, where grain, wine, olives, almonds,
lemons, oranges, tobacco, &amp;c., are produced in abundance, and
the export of olive oil is attaining considerable importance. The
salt works of Margherita di Savoia produce large quantities
of salt, and nitre is extracted near Molfetta.</p>

<p>Railway communications are fairly good, the main line from
Bologna to Brindisi passing through the whole length of Apulia,
by way of Foggia and Bari, and having branches from Foggia
(the main railway centre of Apulia) to Benevento and Caserta,
to Manfredonia, to Lucera and to Rocchetta S. Antonio (and
thence to either Avellino, Potenza or Gioia del Colle), from
Ofantino to Margherita di Savoia, from Barletta to Spinazzola
(between Rocchetta S. Antonio and Gioia del Colle), from Bari
to Putignano, and via Gioia del Colle to Taranto, and from
Brindisi to Taranto, and to Lecce and Otranto; besides which,
there is a steam tramway from Barletta to Bari via Andria.</p>

<p>The most important harbours of Apulia are Brindisi, Bari,
Taranto, Barletta, Molfetta and Gallipoli. The export of olive
oil to foreign countries from the province of Lecce in 1905
amounted to 1048 tons, as against 3395 in 1901; but that to
home ports increased from 7077 to 9025 tons in the same period.
The production of wine was 358,953 tons in 1905 as against
203,995 tons in 1901 (an exceptionally bad year) and 284,156
tons in 1902. Of this 211,872 tons were forwarded by rail and
sea, in the proportion of five to two respectively, the rest being
used for home consumption and as a reserve. The cultivation
of oriental tobacco is extending in the province (see <i>Consular
Report</i>, No. 3672, July 1906).</p>

<p>The population of the province of Foggia was 425,450 (1901)
as against 322,755 in 1871, the chief towns being Foggia (53,151),
Cerignola (34,195), S. Severo (30,040), Monte S. Angelo (21,870),
S. Marco in Lamis (17,309), Lucera (17,515); that of Bari,
827,698 (1901) as against 604,540 in 1871, the chief towns being
Bari (77,478), Andria (49,569), Barletta (42,022), Corato (41,573),

that of Lecce, 706,520 (1901) as against 493,594 in 1871, the chief
towns being Taranto (60,733), Lecce (32,687), Brindisi (25,317),
Martina Franca (25,007), Ostuni (22,997), Francavilla Fontana

<p><span class="bold">&#8219;AQ&#298;BA BEN JOSEPH<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 50-132), Jewish Palestinian rabbi,
of the circle known as <i>tana</i> (<i>q.v.</i>). It is almost impossible to
separate the true from the false in the numerous traditions
respecting his life. He became the chief teacher in the rabbinical
school of Jaffa, where, it is said, he had 24,000 scholars. Whatever
their number, it seems certain that among them was the
celebrated Rabbi Meir, and that through him and others &#8219;Aq&#299;ba
exerted a great influence on the development of the doctrines
embodied in the Mishnah. He sided with Bar Cochebas in the
last Jewish revolt against Rome, recognized him as the Messiah,
and acted as his sword-bearer. Being taken prisoner by the
Romans under Julius Severus, he was flayed alive with circumstances
of great cruelty, and met his fate, according to tradition,
with marvellous steadfastness and composure. He is said by
some to have been a hundred and twenty years old at the time
of his death. He is one of the ten Jewish martyrs whose names
occur in a penitential prayer still used in the synagogue service.
&#8219;Aq&#299;ba was among the first to systematize the Jewish tradition,
and he paved the way for the compilation of the Mishnah.

<p><span class="bold">AQUAE<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> (Lat. for &ldquo;waters&rdquo;), a name given by the Romans

hundred can be identified, some declaring by their modern names
their ancient use: Aix-les-Bains in Savoy (<i>Aquae Sabaudicae</i>),
Aix-en-Provence (<i>Aquae Sextiae</i>), Aix-la-Chapelle or Aachen
(<i>Aquae Grani</i>), &amp;c. Only two occur in Britain: <i>Aquae Sulis</i>&mdash;less
correctly <i>Aquae Solis</i>&mdash;at Bath in Somerset, which was
famous, and Buxton (called <i>Aquae</i> simply), which seems to
have been far less important. Aquae Sulis was occupied by
the Romans almost as soon as they entered the island in
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 43, and flourished till the end of the Roman period. It was
frequented by soldiers quartered in Britain, by the Britons, and
by visitors from north Gaul, and its name was known in Italy,
though patients probably seldom travelled so far. Like most
mineral springs known to the ancients, it was under the protection
of a local deity, the Celtic Sul, whom the Romans equated
with their Minerva. Stately remains of its baths and temple
have been found at various times, especially in 1790 and 1878-1895,

<p><span class="bold">AQUARIUM<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> (plural <i>aquaria</i>), the name given to a receptacle
for a marine flora and fauna. Until comparatively recently,
aquaria were little more than domestic toys, or show-places
of a popular character, but they have now not only assumed
a profound scientific importance for the convenient study of
anatomical and physiological problems in marine botany and
zoology, but have also attained an economic value, as offering
the best opportunities for that study of the habits and environment
of marketable food-fish without which no steps for the
improvement of sea-fisheries can be safely taken. The numerous
&ldquo;zoological stations&rdquo; which have sprung up, chiefly in Europe
and the United States, but also in the British colonies and Japan,
often endeavour to unite these two aims, and have in many cases
become centres of experimental work in problems relating to
fisheries, as well as in less directly practical subjects. Of these
stations, the oldest and the most important is that at Naples,
which, though designed for purely scientific objects, also encourages
popular study by means of a public aquarium. The
following account (1902) of this station by Dr W. Giesbrecht,
a member of the staff, will serve to show the methods and
aims, and the complex and expensive equipment, of a modern
aquarium:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The zoological station at Naples is an institution for the
advancement of biological science&mdash;that is, of comparative
anatomy, zoology, botany, physiology. It serves this end by
providing the biologist with the various objects of his study
and the necessary appliances; it is not a teaching institution.
The station was founded by Dr Anton Dohrn, and opened in the
spring of 1874; it is the oldest and largest of all biological
stations, of which there are now about thirty in existence. Its
two buildings are situated near the seashore in the western town
park (Villa Nazionale) of Naples. The older and larger one,
33 metres long, 24 m. deep, 16 m. high, contains on the ground
floor the aquarium, which is open to the public. On the first floor
there is, facing south, the principal library, ornamented with
fresco paintings, and, facing north, a large hall containing twelve
working tables, several smaller rooms and the secretarial offices.
On the second floor is the physiological laboratory, and on the
third floor the small library, a hall with several working tables,
and the dark rooms used in developing photographs. The ground
floor of the smaller building, which was finished in 1887, contains
the rooms in which the animals are delivered, sorted and preserved,
and the fishing tackle kept, together with the workshop
of the engineer; on the first and second floors are workrooms,
amongst others the botanical laboratory; on the third floor are
store-rooms. In the basement of both buildings, which is continued
underneath the court, there are sea-water cisterns and
filters, engines and store-rooms. The materials for study which
the station offers to the biologist are specimens of marine animals
and plants which abound in the western part of the Mediterranean,
and especially in the Gulf of Naples. To obtain these,
two screw-steamers and several rowing boats are required, which
are moored in the harbour of Mergellina, situated close by. The
larger steamer, &lsquo;Johannes Müller&rsquo; (15 m. long, 2½ m. wide,
1 m. draught), which can steam eight to ten English miles per
hour, is provided with a steam dredge working to a depth of
eighty fathoms. From the small steamer, &lsquo;Frank Balfour,&rsquo;
and the rowing boats, the fishing is done by means of tow-nets.
Besides these there are fishermen and others who daily supply
living material for study. The plankton (small floating animals)
is distributed in the morning, other animals as required. The
animals brought in by the fishermen are at once distributed
amongst the biologists, whereas the material brought up by the
dredges is placed in flat revolving wooden vessels, so as to give
the smaller animals time to come out of their hiding-places.
The students who work in the station have the first claim on
specimens of plants and animals; but specimens are also supplied
to museums, laboratories and schools, and to individuals
engaged in original research elsewhere. Up to the present time
about 4000 such parcels have been despatched, and not infrequently
live specimens of animals are sent to distant places.
This side of the work has been of very great value to science.
The principal appliances for study with which the station provides
the biologist are workrooms furnished with the apparatus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
and chemicals necessary for anatomical research and physiological
experiments and tanks. Every student receives a tank
for his own special use. The large tanks of the principal
aquarium are also at his disposal for purposes of observation
and experiment if necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The water in the tanks is kept fresh by continual circulation,
and is thus charged with the oxygen necessary to the life of the
organisms. It is not pumped into the tanks directly from the
sea, but from three large cisterns (containing 300 cubic metres),
to which it again returns from the tanks. The water wasted or
evaporated during this process is replaced by new water pumped
into the cisterns directly from the sea. The water flows from
the large cisterns into a smaller cistern, from which it is
distributed by means of an electric pump through vulcanite or
lead pipes to the various tanks. The water with which the
tanks on the upper floors are filled is first pumped into large
wooden tanks placed beneath the roof, thence it flows, under
almost constant pressure, into the tanks. The water circulated
in this manner contains by far the largest number of such
animals as are capable of living in captivity in good condition.
Some of them even increase at an undesirable rate, and it
sometimes happens that young Mytilus or Ciona stop up the pipes;
in laying these, therefore, due regard must be had to the arrangements
for cleaning. For the cultivation of very delicate animals
it is necessary to keep the water absolutely free from harmful bacteria;
for this purpose large sand-filters have lately been placed in the
system, through which the water passes after leaving the cisterns. Each
of the smaller cisterns, which are fixed in the workrooms, consist of
two water-tanks, placed one above the other; their frames are of wrought
iron and the walls generally of glass. Vessels containing minute animals
can be placed between these two tanks, receiving their water through a
siphon from the upper tank; the water afterwards flows away into the
lower tank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The twenty-six tanks of the public aquarium (the largest of
which contains 112 cubic metres of water) have stone walls, the
front portion alone being made of glass. As the tanks hold a
very large number of animals in proportion to the quantity of
water, they require to be well aerated. The pipes through which
the water is conducted are therefore placed above the surface of
the water, and the fresh supply is driven through them under
strong pressure. A large quantity of air in the form of fine
bubbles is thus taken to the bottom of the tank and distributed
through the entire mass of water. Should the organisms which
it is desired to keep alive be very minute, there is a danger of
their being washed away by the circulating water. To obviate
this, either the water which flows away is passed through a
strainer, or the water is not changed at all, air being driven
through it by means of an apparatus put into motion by the
drinking-water supply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The library contains about 9000 volumes, which students use
with the help of a slip catalogue, arranged according to authors.
The station has published at intervals since 1879 two periodicals
treating of the organisms of the Mediterranean. One is <i>Fauna
und Flora des Golfes van Neapel</i>, the other <i>Mittheilungen aus der
zoologischen Station zu Neapel</i>. The former consists of monographs
in which special groups of animals and plants are most
exhaustively treated and the Mediterranean species portrayed
according to life in natural colours; up to the present time
twenty-one zoological and five botanical monographs have appeared,
making altogether 1200 4to sheets with about 400 plates.
Of the Mittheilungen, which contain smaller articles on organisms
of the Mediterranean, fourteen volumes in 8vo have been published.
The station also publishes a <i>Zoologischer Jahresbericht</i>,
which at first treated of the entire field of zoology, but since 1886
has been confined principally to comparative anatomy and
ontogeny; it appears eight to nine months after the end of the
year reported. The <i>Guide to the Aquarium</i>, with its descriptions
and numerous pictures, is meant to give the lay visitor an idea
of the marine animal world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are about forty officials, amongst them six zoologists,
one physiologist, one secretary, two draughtsmen, one engineer.
The station is a private institution, open to biologists of all
nations under the following conditions: there are agreements
with the governments of Austria, Baden, Bavaria, Belgium,
Hamburg, Holland, Hesse, Italy, Prussia, Russia, Saxony,
Switzerland, Hungary, Württemberg, the province of Naples, and
the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Strassburg, Columbia
College (New York), and the British Association for the Advancement
of Science, the Smithsonian Institution, and a society of
women in the United States of North America (formerly also with
Bulgaria, Rumania, Spain, the Academy of Sciences in Berlin,
Williams College, University of Pennsylvania), by virtue of which
the governments and corporate bodies named have the right, on
payment of £100 per annum, to send a worker to the station;
this places at his disposal a &lsquo;table&rsquo; or workplace, furnished
with all the necessary appliances and materials as set down in
the agreement. At present there are agreements for thirty-three
tables, and since the foundation of the station nearly 1200
biologists have worked there. The current expenses are paid
out of the table-rents, the entrance fees to the public aquarium,
and an annual subvention paid by the German empire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In England a station on similar lines, but on a smaller scale,
is maintained at Plymouth by the Marine Biological Association
of the United Kingdom, with the help of subsidies from the
government and the Fishmongers&rsquo; Company.</p>

<p>Little difficulty is experienced in maintaining, breeding and
rearing fresh-water animals in captivity, but for many various
reasons it is only by unremitting attention and foresight that
most marine animals can be kept even alive in aquaria, and very
few indeed can be maintained in a condition healthy enough
to breed. Much experience, however, has been gained of late
years at considerable expense, both in England and abroad. In
starting a marine aquarium of whatever size, it should be obvious
that the first consideration must be a supply of the purest possible
water, as free as may be, not only from land-drainage and sewage,
but also from such suspended matters as chalk, fine sand or mud.
This is most ideally and economically secured by placing the
station a few feet above high-water mark, in as sheltered a
position as possible, on a rocky coast, pumping from the sea to
a large reservoir above the station, and allowing the water to
circulate gently thence through the tanks by gravity (Banyuls).
At an inland aquarium (Berlin, Hamburg), given pure water
in the first instance, excellent if less complete results may nevertheless,
be obtained. The next consideration is the method by
which oxygen is to be supplied to the organisms in the aquarium.
Of the two methods hitherto in use, that of pumping a jet of air
into tanks otherwise stagnant or nearly so (Brighton), while
supplying sufficient oxygen, has so many other disadvantages,
that it has not been employed regularly in any of the more
modern aquaria. It is, however, still useful in aerating quite
small bodies of water in which hardy and minute organisms
can be isolated and kept under control. In the other method,
now in general use, a fine jet of water under pressure falls on
to the surface of the tank; this carries down with it a more
than sufficient air-supply, analysis showing in some cases a
higher percentage of oxygen in aquarium water than in the
open sea.</p>

<p>The water supply is best effected by gravity from reservoirs
placed above the tanks, but may be also achieved by direct
pumping from low reservoirs or from the sea to the tanks.
Provided that an unlimited supply of pure water can be obtained
cheaply, the overflow from the tanks is best run to waste; but
in aquaria less fortunately placed, it returns to a storage low-level
reservoir, from which it is again pumped, thus circulating
round and round (Naples, Plymouth). The storage reservoirs
should be in all cases very large in comparison with the bulk of
water in circulation; if practicable, they should be excavated
in rock, and lined with the best cement. Thera is no reason
why they should not be shallow, exposed to light and air, and
cultivated as rock-pools by the introduction of seaweeds and
small animals, but they must then be screened from rain, cold
and dust. The pumps used in circulation will be less likely to
kill minute animals if of the plunger or ram type, rather than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
rotary, and should be of gun-metal or one of the new bronze-alloys
which take a patina in salt water. For the circulating
pipes many materials have been tried. Vulcanite is not only
expensive and brittle, but has other disadvantages; common
iron pipes, coated internally with cement or asphalt or glazed
internally, with all unions and joints cemented, have been used
with more or less success. Probably best of all is common lead
piping, the joints being served with red-lead; water should be
circulated through such pipes till they become coated with insoluble
carbonate, for some time before animals are put into the
tanks. For small installations glass may be used, the joints
being made with marine glue or other suitable cement.</p>

<p>In building the tanks themselves, regard must be had to their
special purposes. If intended for show-tanks for popular admiration,
or for the study of large animals, they must be large
with a plate-glass front; for ordinary scientific work small
tanks with all sides opaque are preferable from every point of
view. According to their character, size and position, fixed tanks
may be of brickwork, masonry or rock, coated in each case with
cement; asphalting the sides offers no particular advantages,
and often gives rise to great trouble and expense. All materials,
and especially the cements, must be of the finest quality procurable.
For smaller and movable tanks, slate slabs bolted or
screwed together have some disadvantages, notably those of
expense, weight and brittleness, but are often used. Better,
cheaper and lighter, if less permanent, are tanks of wood bolted
together, pitched internally. Glass bell-jars, useful in particular
cases, should generally have their sides darkened, except when
required for observation. Provision should always be made
for cleaning every part of the tanks, pipes and reservoirs; all
rock-work in tanks should therefore be removable. As regards
the lighting of fixed tanks, it should always be directly from
above. In all tanks with glass sides, whether large or small,
as much light as possible should be kept from entering through
the glass; otherwise, with a side-light, many animals become
restless, and wear themselves out against the glass, affected by
even so little light as comes through an opposite tank.</p>

<p>In cases where distance from the sea or other causes make it
impracticable to allow the overflow from the tanks to run to
waste, special precautions must be taken to keep the water pure.
Chemically speaking, the chief character of the water in an
aquarium circulation, when compared with that of the open sea,
lies in the excessive quantity of nitrogen present in various forms,
and the reduced alkalinity; these two being probably connected.
The excess of nitrogen is referable to dead animals, to waste
food and to the excreta of the living organisms. The first two
of these sources of contamination may be reduced by care
and cleanliness, and by the maintenance of a flow of water
sufficient to prevent the excessive accumulation of sediment
in the tanks. The following experiment shows the rapid rise
of nitrogen if unchecked. A tank with a considerable fauna
was isolated from the general circulation and aerated by four
air-jets, except during hours 124-166 of the experiment;
column I. shows per 100,000 the nitrogen estimated as ammonia,
column II. the total inorganic nitrogen:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">During this time the alkalinity was reduced to the equivalent of
30 mg. CaCO<span class="su">3</span> per litre, ocean water having an alkalinity equivalent
to 50-55 mg. per litre. It has been suggested that the organic
nitrogen becomes oxidized into nitrous, then into nitric acid,
which lowers the carbonate values. A great deal of reduction
of this nitrogenous contamination can be effected by filtration,
a method first introduced successfully at Hamburg, where a
most thriving aquarium has been maintained by the local
Zoological Society for many years on the circulation principle,
new water being added only to compensate for waste and evaporation.
The filters consist of open double boxes, the inner
having a bottom of perforated slate on which rests rough gravel;
on the latter is fine gravel, then coarse, and finally fine sand.
Filtration may be either upwards or downwards through the
inner box to the outer. Such filters, intercalated between tanks
and reservoir, have been shown by analysis to stop a very large
proportion of nitrogenous matter. It is doubtful whether
aquarium water will not always show an excess of nitrogenous
compounds, but they must be kept down in every way possible.
In small tanks, well lighted, seaweeds can be got to flourish in
a way that has not been found practicable in large tanks with
a circulation; these, with Lamellibranchs and small Crustacea
as scavengers, will be found useful in this connexion. Slight
or occasional circulation should be employed here also, to remove
the film of dust and other matters, which otherwise covers the
surface of the water and prevents due oxygenation.</p>

<p>In such small tanks for domestic use the fauna must be
practically limited to bottom-living animals, but for purposes of
research it is often desired to keep alive larval and other surface-swimming
animals (plankton). In this case a further difficulty
is presented, that of helping to suspend the animals in the water,
and thus to avoid the exhaustion and death which soon follow
their unaided efforts to keep off the bottom; this duty is effected
in nature by specific gravity, tide and surface current. In
order to deal with this difficulty a simple but efficient apparatus
has been devised by Mr E.T. Browne; a &ldquo;plunger,&rdquo; generally
a glass plate or filter funnel, moves slowly up and down in a
bell-jar or other small tank, with a period of rest between each
stroke; the motive power is obtained through a simple bucket-and-siphon
arrangement worked by the overflow from other
tanks. This apparatus (first used at the Plymouth Laboratory
of the Marine Biological Association in 1897, and since introduced
into similar institutions), by causing slight eddies in the water,
keeps the floating fauna in suspension, and has proved very successful
in rearing larvae and in similar work.</p>

etching (<i>q.v.</i>) which imitates washes with a brush. There are
many ways of preparing a plate for aquatint, the following being
recommended by P.G. Hamerton. Have three different solutions
of rosin in rectified alcohol, making them of various degrees
of strength, but always thin enough to be quite fluid, the weakest
solution being almost colourless. First pour the strongest
solution on the plate. When it dries it will produce a granulation;
and you may now bite as in ordinary etching for your
darker tones, stopping out what the acid is not to operate upon,
or you may use a brush charged with acid, perchloride of iron
being a very good mordant for the purpose. After cleaning the
plate, you proceed with the weaker solutions in the same way,
the weakest giving the finest granulation for skies, distances, &amp;c.
The process requires a good deal of stopping-out, and some
burnishing, scraping, &amp;c., at last. Aquatint may be effectively
used in combination with line etching, and still more harmoniously
with soft ground etching in which the line imitates that of
the lead pencil.</p>

<p><span class="bold">AQUAVIVA, CLAUDIO<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> (1542-1615), fifth general of the
Jesuits, the youngest son of the duke d&rsquo;Altri, was born at Naples.
He joined the Jesuits at Rome in 1567, and his high administrative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
gifts marked him out for the highest posts. He was soon
nominated provincial of Naples and then of Rome; and during
this office he offered to join the Jesuit mission to England that
set out under Robert Parsons (<i>q.v.</i>) in the spring of 1580. The
following year, being then only thirty-seven years old, he was
elected, by a large majority, general of the society in succession
to Mercurian, to the great surprise of Gregory XIII.; but the
extraordinary political ability he displayed, and the vast increase
that came to the Society during his long generalate, abundantly
justified the votes of the electors. He, together with Lainez,
may be regarded as the real founder of the Society as it is known
to history. A born ruler, he secured all authority in his own
hands, and insisted that those who prided themselves on their
obedience should act up to the profession. In his first letter
&ldquo;On the happy increase of the Society&rdquo; (25th of July 1581), he
treats of the necessary qualifications for superiors, and points
out that government should be directed not by the maxims of
human wisdom but by those of supernatural prudence. He
successfully quelled a revolt among the Spanish Jesuits, which
was supported by Philip II., and he made use in this matter of
Parsons. A more difficult task was the management of Sixtus V.,
who was hostile to the Society. By consummate tact and boldness
Aquaviva succeeded in playing the king against the pope,
and Sixtus against Philip. For prudential reasons, he silenced
Mariana, whose doctrine on tyrannicide had produced deep
indignation in France; and he also appears to have discountenanced
the action of the French Jesuits in favour of the League,
and was thus able to secure solid advantages when Henry IV.
overcame the confederacy. To him is due the Jesuit system of
education in the book <i>Ratio atque institutio studiorum</i> (Rome,
1586). But the Dominicans denounced it to the Inquisition,
and it was condemned both in Spain and in Rome, on account of
some opinions concerning the Thomist doctrines of the divine
physical premotion in secondary causes and predestination.
The incriminated chapters were withdrawn in the edition of 1591.
In the fierce disputes that arose between the Jesuit theologians
and the Dominicans on the subject of grace, Aquaviva managed,
under Clement VIII. and Paul V., to save his party from a
condemnation that at one time seemed probable. He died at
Rome on the 31st of January 1615, leaving the Society numbering
13,000 members in 550 houses and 15 provinces. The subsequent
influence exercised by the Jesuits, in their golden age,
was largely due to the far-seeing policy of Aquaviva, who
is undoubtedly the greatest general that has governed the
Society.</p>

found near Citium, Amathus, &amp;c. (Cesnola, <i>Cyprus</i>, pp. 187, 341).
In Syria the most striking of Phoenician waterworks is the well
of Ras-el-Ain near Tyre, which consisted of four strong octagonal
towers through which rises to a height of 18 to 20 ft. the water
from four deep artesian wells. The water thus accumulated was
carried off in conduits to reservoirs near the shore, and thence
in vessels or skins to the island. The aqueduct across to the
island is, of course, of Roman work.</p>

<p>It is not possible in all cases to find a satisfactory date for
the numerous conduits which have supplied Jerusalem; some
probably go back to the times of the kings of Judah.
The principal reservoir consists of the three Pools of
<span class="sidenote">Jerusalem.</span>
Solomon which supplied the old aqueduct; the highest is
about 20 ft. above the middle one and 40 above the lowest.
These pools collected the water from Ain Saleh and other springs,
and sent it to the city by two conduits. The higher of these&mdash;
probably the older&mdash;was partly a rock-cut canal, partly carried
on masonry; the siphon-pipe system was adopted across the
lower ground near Rachel&rsquo;s Tomb, where the pipe (15 in. wide) is
formed of large pierced stones embedded in rubble masonry.
The lower conduit is still complete; it winds so much as to be
altogether some 20 m. long. Near the Birket-es-Sultan it passes
over the valley of Hinnom on nine low arches and reaches the
city on the hill above the Tyropeon valley. It enters the Haram
enclosure at the Gate of the Chain (B&#257;b es-Silsila), outside which
is a basin 84 ft. by 42 by 24 deep. It is interesting to note in the
case of the underground tunnel which brought water from the
Virgin&rsquo;s Fountain to the pool of Siloam, that the two boring
parties had no certain means of keeping the line; there is
evidence that they had to make shafts to discover their position,
and that ultimately the parties almost passed one another.
Though the direct distance is 1100 ft., the length of the conduit
is over 1700 ft. Perrot and Chipiez incline to attribute
the Pools of Solomon to the Asmonaeans, followed by Roman
governors, whereas the earlier tunnels of the Kedron and
Tyropeon valley may be Punic-Jewish (see also <i>Palest. Explor.
Fund Mem.</i>, &ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; pp. 346-365). Besides these conduits
excavation has discovered traces of many other cisterns, tunnels
and conduits of various kinds. Many of them point to periods
of great prosperity and engineering enterprise which gave to the
city a water-supply far superior to that which exists at present.</p>

<p>The earliest attempts in Europe to solve the problems of
water-supply were made by the Greeks, who perhaps derived
their ideas from the Phoenicians. It has generally
been held, partly on the strength of a passage in Strabo
<span class="sidenote">Greek</span>
(v. 3. 8, p. 235), and partly owing to the comparative unimportance
of the remains discovered, that the Greek works were
altogether inferior to the Roman. Research in the Greek towns
of Asia Minor, together with a juster appreciation of the remains
as a whole, must be held to modify this view. Among the earliest
examples of Greek work are the tunnels or <i>emissaria</i> which
drained Lake Copais in Boeotia; these, though not strictly
aqueducts, were undoubtedly the precursors of such works,
consisting as they did of subterranean tunnels (<span class="grk" title="hyponomoi">&#8017;&#960;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#959;&#953;</span>) with
vertical shafts (<span class="grk" title="phreatiai">&#966;&#961;&#949;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span>), sixteen of which are still recognizable,
the deepest being about 150 ft. They may be compared with
that described by Polybius as conveying water from Taurus to
Hecatompylos, and with numerous other remains in Asia Minor,
Syria, Phoenicia and Palmyra. Popular legend ascribed them to
Cadmus, just as Argos referred the irrigation of its lands to
Danaüs. They are undoubtedly of great antiquity.</p>

<p>The insufficiency of water, supplied by natural springs and
cisterns hewn in the rock, which in an early age had satisfied the
small communities of Greece, had become a pressing public
question by the time of the Tyrants, of whom Polycrates of
Samos and Peisistratus of Athens were distinguished for their
wisdom and enterprise in this respect. The former obtained the
services of Eupalinus, an engineer celebrated for the skill with
which he had carried out the works for the water-supply of
Megara (see <i>Athen. Mittheil.</i> xxv., 1900, 23) under the direction
of the Tyrant Theagenes (<i>c.</i> 625 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). At Samos the difficulty
lay in a hill which rose between the town and the water source.
Through this hill Eupalinus cut a tunnel 8 ft. broad, 8 ft. high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
and 4200 ft. long, building within the tunnel a channel 3 ft.
broad and 11 ells deep. The water, flowing by an accurately
reckoned declivity, and all along open to the fresh air, was
received at the lower end by a conduit of masonry, and so led
into the town, where it supplied fountains, pipes, baths, cloacae,
&amp;c., and ultimately passed into the harbour (Herod, iii. 60). In
Athens, under the rule of the Peisistratids (<i>c.</i> 560-510 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), a
similarly extensive, if less difficult, series of works was completed
to bring water from the neighbouring hills to supplement the
inadequate supply from the springs. From Hymettus were two
conduits passing under the bed of the Ilissus, most of the course
being cut in the rock. Pentelicus, richer in water, supplied
another conduit, which can still be traced from the modern
village of Chalandri by the air shafts built several feet above the
ground, and at a distance apart of 130-160 ft.; the diameter of
these shafts is 4-5 ft., and the number of them still preserved is
about sixty. Tributary channels conveyed into the main stream
the waters of the district through which it passed. Outside
Athens, those two conduits met in a large reservoir, from which
the water was distributed by a ramification of underground
channels throughout the city. These latter channels vary in
form, being partly round, partly square, and generally walled
with stone; the chief one is sufficiently large for two men to
pass in it. The precise location of the reservoir depends on the
value of Dr Wilhelm Dörpfeld&rsquo;s theory as to the site of the
Enneacrunus of Thucydides and Pausanias (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Athens</a></span>:
<i>Topography and Antiquity</i>). Dörpfeld places it south-west of
the Acropolis, where there is a cistern connected with an aqueduct
which passed under the theatre of Dionysus and on towards the
Ilissus (see map under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Athens</a></span>). Others have placed it south of
the Olympieum in the Ilissus bed. Beside these works water was
brought from Pentelicus in an underground conduit begun by the
emperor Hadrian and completed by Antoninus Pius. This
aqueduct is still in use, having been repaired in 1869.</p>

<p>In Sicily, the works by which Empedocles, it is said, brought
the water into the town of Selinus, are no longer visible; but
it is probable that, like those of Syracuse, they consisted chiefly
of tunnels and pipes laid under the ground. Syracuse was supplied
by two aqueducts, one of which the Athenians destroyed
(Thuc. vi. 100). One was fed by an affluent (the mod. Buttigliara)
of the Anapus (mod. Anapo); it carried the water up to the top
of Epipolae, where the channel was open, and thence down to
the city and finally into the harbour. The other also ascends to
the top of Epipolae, skirts the city on the north, and then
proceeds along the coast. Its course is marked by rectangular
shafts (<i>spiragli</i>) at the bottom of which water is still
visible.</p>

<p>An example of what appears to have been the earliest form
of aqueduct in Greece was discovered in the island of Cos beside
the fountain Burinna (mod. Fountain of Hippocrates) on Mount
Oromedon. It consists of a bell-shaped chamber, built underground
in the hill-side, to receive the water of the spring and
keep it cool; a shaft from the top of the chamber supplied fresh
air. From this reservoir the water was led by a subterranean
channel, 114 ft. long and 6½ ft. high.</p>
<div class="author">(J. M. M.)</div>

<p>In comparing Greek and Roman aqueducts, many writers
have enlarged on the greatness of the latter as an example of
Roman contempt for natural obstacles, or even of
Roman ignorance of the laws of nature. Now, in the
<span class="sidenote">Roman.</span>
first place, the Romans were not unacquainted with the law
that water finds its own level (see Pliny, <i>Hist. Nat.</i> xxxi. 57,
&ldquo;subit altitudinem exortus sui&rdquo;), and took full advantage of
it in the construction of lofty fountains and the supplying of
the upper floors of houses. That they built aqueducts across
valleys in preference to carrying pipes underground was due
simply to economy. Pipes had to be made of lead which was
weak, or of bronze which was expensive; and the Romans
were not sufficiently expert in the casting of large pipes which
would stand a very great pressure to employ them for the whole
course of a great aqueduct. Secondly, the water was so extremely
hard that it was important that the channels should be
readily accessible for repair as well as for the detection of
leakage.<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Moreover, as we shall see, the Roman aqueducts did not,
in fact, preserve a straight line regardless of the configuration
of the country. A striking example is the aqueduct of Nemausus
(Nîmes), the springs of which are some 10 m. from the town,
though the actual distance traversed is about 25. Other
devices, such as changing the level and then modifying the slope,
and siphon arrangements of various kinds, were adopted (as
in the aqueduct at Aspendus).</p>

<p>Sextus Julius Frontinus, appointed <i>curator aquarum</i> in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 97,
mentions in his treatise <i>de aquaeductibus urbis Romae</i> (on the
aqueducts of the city of Rome) nine aqueducts as being in use
in his time (the lengths of the aqueducts as given here follow
his measurements). These are: (1) <span class="sc">Aqua Appia</span>, which took its
rise between the 6th and 7th milestones of the Via Collatina,
and measured from its source to the Porta Trigemina 11
Roman miles, of which all but about 300 ft. were below ground.
It appears to have been the first important enterprise of the
kind at Rome, and was the work of the censor Appius Claudius
Caecus, from whom it derived its name. The date of its construction
was 312 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (2) <span class="sc">Anio Vetus</span>, constructed in 272-269
<span class="scs">B.C.</span> by the censor Manius Curius Dentatus. From its source
near Tivoli, on the left side of the Anio, it flowed some 43 m.,<a name="fa2h" id="fa2h" href="#ft2h"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
of which only 1100 ft. was above ground. At the distance of
2 m. from Rome (Frontinus, i. 21), it parted into two courses,
one of which led to the <i>horti Asiniani</i>, and was thence distributed;
while the other (<i>rectus ductus</i>) led by the temple of
Spes to the Porta Esquilina. (3) <span class="sc">Aqua Marcia</span>, reconstructed
in 1869-1870 under the name of Acqua Pia or Marcia-Pia after
Pius IX. (though from Tivoli to Rome the modern aqueduct
takes an entirely different course), rising on the left side of the
Via Valeria near the 36th milestone. It traversed 61¾ m.,
of which 54¼ were underground, and for the remaining distance
was carried partly on substructions and partly on arches. It
was the work of the praetor Quintus Marcius Rex (144-140 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>),
not of Ancus Marcius, the fourth king of Rome, as Pliny (<i>N.H.</i>
xxxi. 3) fancied, and took its name from its constructor. Its
waters were celebrated for their coolness and excellent quality.
Its volume was largely increased by Augustus, who added to it
the Aqua Augusta; and it was repaired and restored by Titus,
Septimus Severus, Caracalla and Diocletian. (4) <span class="sc">Aqua Tepula</span>,
from its source (now known as Sorgente Preziosa) in the district
of Tusculum, to Rome, was some 11 m. in length. The first
portion of its course must have been almost entirely subterranean
and is not now traceable. For the last 6½ m. it ran on
the same series of arches that carried the Aqua Marcia, but at
a higher level. It was the work of the censors Cn. Servilius
Caepio and L. Cassius Longinus, and was completed in the year
125 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Its water is warm (about 63° Fahr.) and not of the
best quality. (5) The <span class="sc">Aqua Julia</span>, from a source 2 m. from that
of the Tepula, joined its course at the 10th milestone of the Via
Latina. The combined stream, after a distance of 4 m., was
received in a reservoir, and then once more divided into two
channels. The entire length of the Julia was 15½ m. It was
constructed in the year 33 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by M. Vipsanius Agrippa, who
also built the (6) <span class="sc">Aqua Virgo</span> which, from its origin at a copious
spring in a marsh on the Via Collatina, measured 14 m. in length;
it was conveyed in a channel, partly under and partly above
ground. It was begun in the year 33 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> and was celebrated
for the excellence of its waters. It was restored to use by
Pius V. in 1570. (7) <span class="sc">Aqua Alsietina</span> or <span class="sc">Augusta</span>, the source
of which is the Lacus Alsietinus (mod. Lago di Martignano), to
the north of Rome, was over 22 m. in length, of which 358 paces
were on arches. It was the work of Augustus, probably with
the object of furnishing water for his <i>naumachia</i> (a basin for
sham sea-fights), and not for drinking purposes. Its course is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
unknown, as no remains of it exist, but an inscription relating
to it is given in <i>Notizie d. Scant</i> (1887), p. 182. (8, 9) The <span class="sc">Aqua
Claudia</span> and <span class="sc">Anio Novus</span> were two aqueducts begun by Caligula
in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 38 and completed by Claudius in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 52. The springs
of the former belonged to the same group as those of the Marcia,
and were situated near the 38th milestone of the Via Sublacensis,
not far from its divergence from the Via Valeria, while the original
intake of the latter from the river Anio was 4 m. farther along
the same road. As the water was thick it was collected in a
purifying tank, and 4 m. below, a branch stream, the Rivus
Herculaneus, was added to it. According to Frontinus, over
10 m. of the course of the Claudia and nearly 9½ of that of the
Anio Novus were above ground. Seven miles out of Rome they
united and ran from that point into Rome, following a natural
isthmus formed by a lava stream from the Alban volcano, upon
a line of arches, which still forms one of the most conspicuous
features of the Campagna. The original inscription of Claudius
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 52) on the Porta Maggiore, by which the Aqua Claudia and
Anio Novus crossed the Via Praenestina and the Via Labicana,
gives the length of the Aqua Claudia as 45 m., and that of the
Anio Novus as 62 m. Frontinus, on the other hand, gives
46.406 m. (<i>i.e.</i> about 43 English miles) and 58.700 m. (<i>i.e.</i> about
54 English miles). Albertini (<i>Mélanges de l&rsquo;École Française</i>, 1906,
305) explains the difference as due to the fact that Frontinus
was calculating the length of the Claudia from the farthest
spring, the Fons Albudinus, and that of the Anio Novus from
the new intake constructed by Trajan in one of the three lakes
constructed by Nero for the adornment of his villa above Subiaco.
Two other inscriptions on the Porta Maggiore record restorations
by Vespasian in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70, and by Titus in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 80. That the
aqueducts should be spoken of as <i>vetustate dilapsi</i> so soon after
their construction is not a little surprising, and may be attributed
either to hasty construction in order to complete them
by a fixed date, or to jobbery by the imperial freedmen who
under Claudius were especially powerful, or to the fact that a line
of arches intended originally in all probability for the Aqua
Claudia alone was made to carry the Anio Novus as well.</p>

<p>The size of the channels (<i>specus</i>) of the principal aqueducts
varies considerably at different points of their course. The
Anio Novus has the largest of them all, measuring 3 to 4 ft. wide
and 9 ft. high to the top of the roof, which is pointed. They
are lined with hard cement (<i>opus signinum</i>) containing fragments
of broken brick. Those aqueducts of which the most conspicuous
remains exist in the neighbourhood of Rome are the
four from the upper valley of the Anio, the two which took
their supply and their name from the river itself, and the Marcia
and the Claudia, which originated from the same group of springs,
in the floor of the Anio valley 6 m. below Subiaco. Those of the
Anio Vetus, which travelled at a considerably lower level than
the other three, are the least conspicuous, while the Claudia and
Anio Novus as a rule kept close together, the latter at the highest
level of all. The ruins of bridges and substructions in the Anio
valley down to Tivoli, though comparatively little known, are
of great importance. In all the aqueducts the original construction
of the bridges was in <i>opus quadratum</i> (masonry), while
the substructions are in brick-faced concrete; but the bridges
are as a rule strengthened (and often several times) with reinforcing
walls of concrete faced with <i>opus reticulatum</i> or brickwork.
Below Tivoli, where the Anio leaves its narrow valley,
the aqueducts sweep round towards the Alban hills, and pass
through some very difficult country between Tivoli and Gallicano,
alternately crossing ravines, some of which are as much
as 300 ft. deep, and tunnelling through hills.<a name="fa3h" id="fa3h" href="#ft3h"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>The engineering skill displayed is remarkable, and one wonders
what instruments were employed&mdash;probably the so-called
<i>chorobates</i>, an improvement upon the ordinary water-level
(Vitruvius viii. 6), though this would be slow and complicated.
The optical properties of glass lenses were, however, unknown to
the ancients, and the <i>dioptra</i>, or angle measure, was considered
by Vitruvius less trustworthy than the <i>chorobates</i> for the planning
of aqueducts (cf. E. Hultsch, <i>s.v</i>. in Pauly-Wissowa, <i>Real-encyclopädie</i>).
The aqueducts as a rule were carried on separate
bridges, though all four united at the Ponte Lupo, a huge
structure, which after the addition of all the four, and with the
inclusion of all the later strengthening walls that were found
necessary in course of time, measures 105 ft. in height, 508 in
length, and 46 in thickness at the bottom, without including
the buttresses. From Gallicano onwards the course of these
four aqueducts follows the lower slopes of the Alban Hills.
Previous writers on the subject have been unable to determine
their course, which is largely subterranean; but it can be
followed step by step with the indications given by the presence
of the calcareous deposit which was thrown out at the <i>putei</i> or
shafts (which were, as a rule, placed at intervals of 240 ft., as
were the <i>cippi</i>) when the <i>specus</i> was cleaned; and remains of
bridges, though less important, owing to the less difficult character
of the country, are not entirely absent (cf. the works by
T. Ashby cited in bibliography).<a name="fa4h" id="fa4h" href="#ft4h"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Near the 7th milestone of
the Via Latina at Le Capanelle, the Aqua Claudia and Anio
Novus emerge from their underground course, and run into
Rome upon the long series of arches already mentioned, passing
over the Porta Maggiore. The Claudia sent off an important
branch from the Porta Maggiore over the Caclian to the Palatine,
but the main aqueduct soon reached its termination. A mile
farther on the Aqua Marcia also, owing to the gradual slope of
the ground towards Rome, begins to be supported on arches,
which were also used to carry the Aqua Tepula and the Aqua
Julia (of the two latter, before their junction with the Marcia, no
remains exist above ground, but inscribed <i>cippi</i> of the last named
and its underground channel have been found at Le Capanelle,
and <i>cippi</i> also close to its springs, which are a little way above
Grottaferrata at Gli Squarciarelli). The Anio Vetus followed
the same line, but kept underground (as was natural at the early
period at which it was constructed) until the immediate neighbourhood
of Rome, near the locality known as &ldquo;ad Spem
veterem&rdquo; (from a temple of Spes, of which no remains are known)
close to the Porta Maggiore. At this point, besides the aqueducts
named, the Aqua Appia, as we are told by Frontinus, entered the
city, and received an important branch, the Appia Augusta.
No remains of either have been discovered outside the city.</p>

<p>The Aqua Alexandrina must also have entered the city here,
though its channel, which lay at some depth below ground, has
not been discovered. Considerable remains of its brick aqueducts
exist in the district between the Via Praenestina and the Via
Labicana.</p>

<p>Of the two aqueducts on the right bank of the Tiber, the
Alsietina, as we have said, has no remains at all, while those
of the Traiana are not of great importance. The line of the
aqueducts was marked by <i>cippi</i>, inscribed (in the case of the
Anio Vetus, Marcia, Tepula, Julia and Virgo&mdash;those of the
Claudia and Anio Novus are uninscribed, and those of the
Traiana are differently worded) with the name of the aqueduct,
the distance from the next <i>cippus</i> (generally 240 ft.) and the
number, counting from Rome (not from the springs). These
boundary stones were erected in pairs, to mark off the strip of
land 30 ft. in width reserved for the aqueduct, and for the road
or path which generally followed it. The shafts (<i>putei</i>) often
stood, but not necessarily, at the same points as the <i>cippi</i>.</p>

<p>To these nine must be added the two following, constructed
after Frontinus&rsquo;s time: (10) <span class="sc">Aqua Traiana</span>, from springs to the
north-west of the Lacus Sabatinus (Lago di Bracciano), constructed
by Trajan in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 109, about 36½ English miles in length.
It was restored by Paul V. in 1611, who made use of and largely
transformed the remains of the ancient aqueduct; he allowed
some of the inferior water of the lake to flow into the channel, and
it is thus no longer used for drinking. (11) <span class="sc">Aqua Alexandrina</span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
rising about 14 English miles from Rome, between the Via Praenestina
and the Via Labicana, the work of Alexander Severus
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 226). The springs now supply the modern Acqua Felice,
constructed by Sixtus V. in 1585, but the course of the latter
is mainly subterranean and not identical with that of the
former.</p>

<p>It is agreed that these eleven are all that were constructed.
Procopius speaks of fourteen (and the Regionary catalogues
mention others), but this number includes branch conduits. All
the aqueducts ended in the city in huge <i>castella</i> or reservoirs for
the purpose of distribution. Vitruvius recommends the division
of these into three parts&mdash;one for the supply of fountains, &amp;c.,
one for the public baths and one for private consumers. In the
Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele at Rome there are still to be seen
the remains of a large ornamental fountain built probably for the
Aqua Julia by Domitian or Alexander Severus (Jordan-Hülsen,
<i>Topographie</i>, i. 3350). Besides these main <i>castella</i> there were also
many minor <i>castella</i> in various parts of the city for sub-distribution.
To allow the water to purify itself before being distributed
in the city, filtering and settling tanks (<i>piscinae limariae</i>) were
built outside the walls. These <i>piscinae</i> were covered in with a
vaulted roof, and were sometimes on a very large scale, as in the
example still preserved at Fermo, which consists of two stories,
each having three oblong basins communicating with each other;
or the Piscina Mirabilis at Baiae, which is covered in by a vaulted
roof, supported on forty-eight pillars and perforated to permit
the escape of foul air. Two stairs lead by forty steps to the
bottom of the reservoir. In the middle of the basin is a sinking
to collect the deposit of the water. The walls and pillars are
coated with a stucco so hard as to resist a tool.</p>

<p>The oversight of aqueducts was placed, in the times of the
republic, under the aediles, who were not, however, the constructors
of them; of the four aqueducts built during this
period, three are the work of censors, one (the Marcia) of a
praetor. Under the empire this task devolved on special
officials styled <i>Curatores Aquarum</i>, instituted by Augustus,
who, as he himself says, &ldquo;rivos aquarum omnium refecit&rdquo; (inscription
on the arch by which the Aqua Marcia crossed the Via
Tiburtina).</p>
<div class="author">(T. As.)</div>

<p>Among the aqueducts outside Italy, constructed in Roman
times and existing still, the most remarkable are: (1) the aqueduct
at Nîmes (Nemausus), erected probably by Vipsanius
Agrippa in the time of Augustus, which rose to 160 ft. The Pont
du Card, as this aqueduct is now called, consists of three tiers of
arches across the valley of the river Gardon. In the lowest
tier are six arches, of which one has a span of 75 ft., the others
each 60 ft. In the second tier are eleven arches, each with a span
of 75 ft. In the third tier are thirty-five smaller arches which
carried the <i>specus</i>. As a bridge, the Pont du Gard has no rival
for lightness and boldness of design among the existing remains
of works of this class carried out in Roman times. (2) The
aqueduct bridges at Segovia (Merckel, <i>Ingenieurtechnik</i>, pp.
566-568), Tarragona (<i>ibid.</i> 565-566), and Merida in Spain, the
former being 2400 ft. long, with 109 arches of fine masonry, in
two tiers, and reaching the height of 102 ft. The bridge at
Tarragona is 876 ft. long and 83 ft. high. (3) At Mainz are the
ruins of an aqueduct 7000 yds. long, about half of which is
carried on from 500 to 600 pillars (<i>Archaeological Journal</i>,
xlvii., 1890, pp. 211-214). This aqueduct was built by the XIVth
legion and was for the use of the camp, not for the townspeople.
For the similar aqueduct at Luynes see <i>Arch. Journ.</i> xlv. (1888),
pp. 235-237. Similar witnesses of Roman occupation are to be
seen in Dacia, Africa (see especially under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carthage</a></span>), Greece
and Asia Minor. (4) The aqueduct at Jouy-aux-Arches, near
Metz, which originally extended across the Moselle, here very
broad, conveyed to the city an abundance of excellent water
from Gorze. From a large reservoir at the source of the aqueduct
the water passed along subterranean channels built of hewn
stone, and sufficiently spacious for a man to walk in them upright.
Similar channels received the water after it had crossed
the Moselle by this bridge, at the distance of about 6 m. from
Metz, and conveyed it to the city. The bridge consisted of only
one row of arches nearly 60 ft. high. The middle arches have
given way under the force of the water, but the others are still
perfectly solid. This aqueduct is probably to be attributed to
the latter half of the 4th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> It is for the use of the
town; hence its size. (5) One of the principal bridges of the
aqueduct of Antioch in Syria is 700 ft. long, and at the deepest
point 200 ft. high. The lower part consists almost entirely of
solid wall, and the upper part of a series of arches with very
massive pillars. The masonry and design are rude. The water
supply was drawn from several springs at a place called Beit el-Ma
(anc. Daphne) about 4 or 5 m. from Antioch. From these
separate springs the water was conducted by channels of hewn
stone into a main channel, similarly constructed, which traversed
the rest of the distance, being carried across streams and valleys
by means of arches or bridges. (6) At the village of Moris, about
an hour&rsquo;s distance north-west from the town of Mytilene, is the
bridge of an aqueduct, carried by massive pillars built of large
hewn blocks of grey marble, and connected by means of three
rows of arches, of which the uppermost is of brick. The bridge
extended about 500 ft. in length, and at the deepest point was
from 70 to 80 ft. high. Judged by the masonry and the graceful
design, it has been thought to be a work of the age of Augustus.
Remains of this aqueduct are to be seen at Larisson Lamarousia,
an hour&rsquo;s distance from Moris, and at St Demetri, two hours
and a half from Ayasos, on the road to Vasilika.</p>

<p>The whole subject of the ancient and medieval aqueducts of
Asia Minor has been considered in great detail by G. Weber
(&ldquo;Wasserleitungen in kleinasiatischen Städten,&rdquo; in
the <i>Jahrbuch des kaiserl. deutsch. archäolog. Instit.</i>
xix., 1904; see also earlier articles in <i>Jahrbuch</i>, 1892,
<span class="sidenote">Asia Minor.</span>
1899). The aqueducts examined are those at Pergamum,
Laodicea and Smyrna (in the earlier articles), and those at
Metropolis (Ionia), Tralles (Aidin), Antioch-on-Maeander, Aphrodisias,
Trapezopolis, Hierapolis, Apamea Cibotus and Antioch
in Pisidia. In most of these cases it is difficult or even impossible
to decide whether the work is Hellenistic or Roman;
to the Romans Weber inclines to attribute, <i>e.g.</i> those at Metropolis,
Tralles (perhaps), Aphrodisias; to the Greeks, <i>e.g.</i> those
at Antioch-on-Maeander and Antioch in Pisidia. Since, therefore,
a detailed description of these remains does not provide
material for any satisfactory generalizations as to the distinctive
features of Hellenistic and Roman work, it will be
sufficient here to mention a few of the more interesting
discoveries.</p>

<p>In the case of Metropolis, the aqueduct in the valley of the
Astraeus consisted of an arcade about 13 to 16 ft. high. Nearer
to the town in the hills there are distinct traces of a canal with
brick walls. It is clear that the water could not have served
more than the lower parts of the town, the acropolis of which
is nearly 200 ft. above the level of the conduit. In the case of
Tralles the water was supplied by a high pressure conduit and
distributed from the acropolis, where there are the remains of a
basin (13 ft. by 10) arched over with brick. The ancient aqueduct
is to be distinguished from a later, probably Byzantine,
canal conduit, the course of which avoids the deeper depressions,
crossed by the old aqueduct. Of the Antioch-on-Maeander aqueduct
only a few clay-pipes remain, and the same is true of the
aqueduct which was built by Carminius in the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>
to supply the community when reinforced by the amalgamation
of Plarasa and Tauropolis; two of its basins are still distinguishable,
but the two water-towers which are still standing belong
to a later Byzantine structure. Trapezopolis was supplied
from Mt. Salbacus (Baba Dagh): some twenty stone-pipes
have been found built into a low wall which varies from 3¼ to
about 5 ft. wide. Of the pillars which carried the conduit-pipe
to Antioch in Pisidia, nineteen are still standing. Each arch
consists of eleven keystones; no cement was used. The conduit,
which was high-pressure, ends in a distributing tower and
reservoir.</p>
<div class="author">(J. M. M.)</div>

<p>II. <i>Medieval.</i>&mdash;The aqueduct near Spoleto, which now serves
also as a bridge, is deserving of notice as an early instance of the
use of the pointed arch, belonging as it does to the 7th or 8th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>
century. It has ten arches, remarkable for the elegance of their
design and the airy lightness of their proportions, each over
66 ft. in span, and about 300 ft. in height.</p>

<p>The aqueduct of Pyrgos, near Constantinople, is a remarkable
example of works of this class carried out in the later times of
the Roman empire, and consisted of two branches.
From this circumstance it was called Egri Kemer
<span class="sidenote">Constantinople.</span>
(&ldquo;the Crooked Aqueduct&rdquo;), to distinguish it from
the Long Aqueduct, situated near the source of the waters.
One of the branches extends 670 ft. in length, and is 106 ft. in
height at the deepest part. It is composed of three tiers of
arches, those in each row increasing in width from the bottom
to the top&mdash;an arrangement very properly introduced with the
view of saving materials without diminishing the strength of the
work. The two upper rows consisted of arches of semicircles,
the lower of Gothic arches; and this circumstance leads to the
belief that the date of the structure is about the 10th century.
The breadth of the building at the base was 21 ft., and it diminished
with a regular batter on each side to the top, where it was
only 11 ft. The base also was protected by strong buttresses
or counterforts, erected against each of the pillars. The other
branch of the aqueduct was 300 ft. long, and consisted of twelve
semicircular arches. This aqueduct serves to convey to Constantinople
the waters of the valley of Belgrad, one of the
principal sources from which the city is supplied. These are
situated on the heights of Mount Haemus, the extremity of the
Balkan Mountains, which overhangs the Black Sea. The water
rises about 15 m. from the city, and between 3 and 4 m. west
of the village of Belgrad, in three sources, which run in three
deep and very confined valleys. These unite a little below the
village, and then are collected into a large reservoir. After
flowing a mile or two from this reservoir, the waters are augmented
by two other streams, and conveyed by a channel of
stone to the Crooked Aqueduct. From this they are conveyed
to another which is the Long Aqueduct; and then, with various
accessions, into a third, termed the Aqueduct of Justinian.
From this they enter a vaulted conduit, which skirts the hills on
the left side of the valley, and crosses a broad valley 2 m. below
the Aqueduct of Justinian, by means of an aqueduct, with two
tiers of arches of a very beautiful construction. The conduit
then proceeds onward in a circuitous route, till it reaches the
reservoir of Egri Kapu, situated just without and on the walls
of the city. From this the water is conducted to the various
quarters of the city, and also to the reservoir of St Sophia, which
supplies the seraglio of the grand signior. The Long Aqueduct
(Usun Kemer) is more imposing by its extent than the Crooked
one, but is far inferior in the regularity of design and disposition
of the materials. It is evidently a work of the Turks. It consists
of two tiers of arches, the lower being forty-eight in number,
and the upper fifty. The whole length was about 2200 ft., and
the height 80 ft. The aqueduct of Justinian (Muallak Kemer
or &ldquo;Hanging Aqueduct&rdquo;) is without doubt one of the finest
monuments which remain to us of the middle ages. It consists
of two tiers of large pointed arches, pierced transversely. Those
of the lower story have 55 ft. of span, the upper ones 40 ft.
The piers are supported by strong buttresses, and at different
heights they have little arches passing through them laterally,
which relieve the deadness of the solid pillar. The length of this
aqueduct is 720 ft. and the height 108 ft. This aqueduct has
been attributed both to Constantine I. and to Justinian, the latter
being perhaps the more probable.</p>

<p>Besides the waters of Belgrad, Constantinople was supplied
from several other principal sources, one of which took its rise
on the heights of the same mountains, 3 or 4 m. east of Belgrad.
This was conveyed in a similar manner by an arched channel
elevated, when it was necessary, on aqueduct bridges, till it
reached the northern parts of the city. It was in the course of
this aqueduct that the contrivance of the <i>souterasi</i> or hydraulic
obelisks, described by Andréossy (on his voyage to the Black Sea,
the account of the Thracian Bosporus), was constructed, which
excited some attention, as being an improvement on the method
of conducting water by aqueduct bridges. &ldquo;The souterasi,&rdquo;
says Andréossy, &ldquo;are masses of masonry, having generally the
form of a truncated pyramid or an Egyptian obelisk. To form
a conduit with souterasi, we choose sources of water, the level
of which is several feet higher than the reservoir by which it is
to be distributed over the city. We bring the water from its
sources in subterranean canals, slightly declining until we come
to the borders of a valley or broken ground. We there raise on
each side a souterasi, to which we adapt vertically leaden pipes
of determinate diameters, placed parallel to the two opposite
sides of the building. These pipes are disjoined at the upper
part of the obelisk, which forms a sort of basin, with which the
pipes are connected. The one permits the water to rise to the
level from whence it had descended; by the other, the water
descends from this level to the foot of the souterasi, where it
enters another canal underground, which conducts it to a second
and to a third souterasi, where it rises and again descends, as at
the last station. Here a reservoir receives it and distributes it
in different directions by orifices of which the discharge is known.&rdquo;
Again he says, &ldquo;it requires but little attention to perceive that
this system of conducting tubes is nothing but a series of siphons
open at their upper part, and communicating with each other.
The expense of a conduit by souterasi is estimated at only one-fifth
of that of an aqueduct with arcades.&rdquo; There seems to be
really no advantage in these pyramids, further than as they serve
the purpose of discharging the air which collects in the pipes.
They are in themselves an evident obstruction, and the water
would flow more freely without any interruption of the kind. In
regard to the leaden pipes, again, they would have required,
with so little head pressure as is stated, to be used of very extraordinary
dimensions to pass the same quantity of water as was
discharged along the arched conduits (see also works quoted
under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Constantinople</a></span>). The other principal source from
which Constantinople is supplied, is from the high grounds 6 or 8
m. west of the town, from which it is conducted by conduits
and arches, in the same manner as the others. The supply
drawn from all these sources, as detailed by Andréossy, amounted
to 400,000 cubic ft. per day.</p>
<div class="author">(A. S. M.; J. M. M.)</div>

<p>III. <i>Modern Construction.</i>&mdash;Where towns are favourably situated
the aqueduct may be very short and its cost bear a relatively
small proportion to the total outlay upon a scheme of
water supply, but where distant sources have to be relied upon
<span class="sidenote">Aqueducts and water supply.</span>
the cost of the aqueduct becomes one of the
most important features in the scheme, and the quantity
of water obtainable must be considerable to justify the outlay.
Hence it is that only very large towns can undertake the responsibility
for this expenditure. In Great Britain it has in all large
schemes become a condition that, when a town is permitted to
go outside its own watershed, it shall, subject to a priority of
a certain number of gallons per day per head of its own inhabitants,
allow local authorities, any part of whose district is
within a certain number of miles of the aqueduct, to take a
supply on reasonable terms. The first case in which this principle
was adopted on a large scale was the Thirlmere scheme sanctioned
by parliament in 1879, for augmenting the supply of Manchester.
The previous supply was derived from a source only about 15 m.
distant, and the cost of the aqueduct, chiefly cast-iron pipes,
was insignificant compared with the cost of the impounding
reservoirs. But Thirlmere is 96 m. distant from the service
reservoir near Manchester, and the cost of the aqueduct was
more than 90% of the total cost. As a supply of about
50,000,000 gallons a day is available the outlay was justifiable,
and the water is in fact very cheaply obtained. Liverpool
derives a supply of about 40,000,000 gallons a day from the river
Vyrnwy in North Wales, 68 m. distant, and Birmingham has
constructed works for impounding water in Radnorshire, and conveying
it a distance of 74 m., the supply being about 75,000,000
gallons a day. In the year 1899 an act of parliament was passed
authorizing the towns of Derby, Leicester, Sheffield and Nottingham,
jointly to obtain a supply of water from the head waters of
the river Derwent in Derbyshire. Leicester is 60 m. distant from
this source, and its share of the supply is about 10,000,000 gallons
a day. For more than half the distance, however, the aqueduct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
is common to Derby and Nottingham, which together are entitled
to about 16,000,000 gallons a day, and the expense to Leicester
is correspondingly reduced. These are the most important cases
of long aqueducts in England, and all are subsequent to 1879.
It is obvious, therefore, how greatly the design and construction
of the aqueduct have grown in importance, and what care must
be Exercised in order that the supply upon which such large
populations depend may not be interrupted, and that the country
through which such large volumes of water are conveyed may not
be flooded in consequence of the failure of any of the works.</p>

<p>Practically only two types of aqueduct are used in England.
The one is built of concrete, brickwork, &amp;c., the other of cast-iron
(or, in special circumstances, steel) pipes. In the
former type the water surface coincides with the
<span class="sidenote">Construction.</span>
hydraulic gradient, and the conditions are those of an
artificial river; the aqueduct must therefore be carefully graded throughout, so that the fall available between source and
termination may be economically distributed. This condition
requires that the ground in which the work is built shall be at
the proper elevation; if at any point this is not the case, the
aqueduct must be carried on a substructure built up to the
required level. Such large structures are, however, extremely
expensive, and require elaborate devices for maintaining water-tightness against the expansion and contraction of the masonry
due to changes of temperature. They are now only used where
their length is very short, as in cases where mountain streams
have to be crossed, and even these short lengths are avoided by
some engineers, who arrange that the aqueduct shall pass,
wherever practicable, under the streams. Where wide valleys
interrupt the course of the built aqueduct, or where the absence
of high ground prevents the adoption of that type at any part
of the route, the cast-iron pipes hereafter referred to are used.</p>

<p>The built aqueduct may be either in tunnel, or cut-and-cover,
the latter term denoting the process of cutting the trench,
building the floor, side-walls, and roof, and covering
with earth, the surface of the ground being restored
<span class="sidenote">Masonry aqueducts.</span>
as before. For works conveying water for domestic
supply, the aqueduct is in these days, in England, always
covered. Where, as is usually the case, the water is derived
from a tract of mountainous country, the tunnel work is sometimes
very heavy. In the case of the Thirlmere aqueduct, out
of the first 13 m. the length of the tunnelled portions is 8 m., the
longest tunnel being 3 m. in length. Conditions of time, and the
character of the rock, usually require the use of machinery for
driving, at any rate in the case of the longer tunnels. For the
comparatively small tunnels required for aqueducts, two percussion
drilling machines are usually mounted on a carriage, the
motive power being derived from compressed air sent up the
tunnel in pipes. The holes when driven are charged with explosives
and fired. In the Thirlmere tunnels, driven through very hard Lower
Silurian strata, the progress was about 13 yds. a week at each face,
work being carried on continuously day and night for six days a week.
Where the character of the country through which the aqueduct passes
is much the same as that from which the supply is derived, the tunnels
need not be lined with concrete, &amp;c., more than is absolutely
necessary for retaining the water and supporting weak places in
the rock; the floor, however, is nearly always so treated. The
lining, whether in tunnel or cut-and-cover, may be either of
concrete, or brickwork, or of concrete faced with brickwork.
To ensure the impermeability of work constructed with these materials is in practice
somewhat difficult, and no matter how much care is taken by
those supervising the workmen, and even by the workmen themselves,
it is impossible to guarantee entire freedom from trouble in this
respect. With a wall only about 15 in. thick, any neglect is
certain to make the work permeable; frequently the labourers
do not distribute the broken stone and fine material of the concrete
uniformly, and no matter how excellent the design, the
quality of materials, &amp;c., a leak is sure to occur at such places
(unless, indeed, the pressure of the outside water is superior
and an inflow occurs). A further cause of trouble lies in the
water which flows from the strata on to the concrete, and
washes away some of the cement upon which the work depends
for its watertightness, before it has time to set. For this reason
it is advisable to put in the floor before, and not after,
the sidewalls and arch have been built, otherwise the only outlet for the
water in the strata is through the ground on which the floor has
to be laid. Each length of about 20 ft. should be completely
constructed before the next is begun, the water then having
an easy exit at the leading end. Manholes, by which the aqueduct
can be entered, are usually placed in the roof at convenient
intervals; thus, in the case of the Thirlmere aqueduct, they
occur at every quarter of a mile.</p>

<p>In some parts of America aqueducts are frequently constructed
of wood, being then termed flumes. These are probably more
extensively used in California than in any other part
of the world, for conveying large quantities of water
<span class="sidenote">Timber aqueducts.</span>
which is required for hydraulic mining, for irrigation,
for the supply of towns and for transporting timber. The flumes
are frequently carried along precipitous mountain slopes, and
across valleys, supported on trestles. In Fresno county, California,
there is a flume 52 m. in length for transporting timber
from the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the plain below; it has a
rectangular V-shaped section, 3 ft. 7 in. wide at the top, and 21 in.
deep vertically. The boards which form the sides are 1¼ in.
thick, and some of the trestlework is 130 ft. high. The steepest
grade occurs where there is a fall of 730 ft. in a length of 3000 ft.
About 9,000,000 ft. of timber were used in the construction.
At San Diego there is a flume 35 m. long for irrigation and
domestic supply, the capacity being 50 ft. per second; it has 315
trestle bridges (the longest of which is that across Los Coches
Creek, 1794 ft. in length and 65 ft. in height) and 8 tunnels,
and the cost was $900,000. The great bench flume of the
Highline canal, Colorado, is 2640 ft. in length, 28 ft. wide, and
7 ft. deep; the gradient is 5.28 ft. per mile, and the discharge
1184 ft. per second.</p>

<p>As previously stated, the type of aqueduct built of concrete,
&amp;c., can only be adopted where the ground is sufficiently elevated
to carry it, and where the quantity of water to be conveyed
makes it more economical than piping. Where the falling contour
<span class="sidenote">Aqueduct in iron piping.</span>
is interrupted by valleys too wide for a masonry structure above
the surface of the ground, the detached portions of the built
aqueduct must be connected by rows of pipes laid beneath, and following
the main undulations of, the surface. In such cases the built aqueduct
terminates in a chamber of sufficient size to enclose the mouths
of the several pipes, which, thus charged, carry the water under
the valley up to a corresponding chamber on the farther hillside
from which the built aqueduct again carries on the supply.
These connecting pipes are sometimes called siphons, although
they have nothing whatever to do with the principle of a siphon,
the water simply flowing into the pipe at one end and out at the
other under the influence of gravity, and the pressure of the
atmosphere being no element in the case. The pipes are almost
always made of cast-iron, except in such cases as the lower part
of some siphons, where the pressure is very great, or where they
are for use abroad, when considerations of weight are of importance,
and when they are made of rolled steel with riveted or
welded seams. It is frequently necessary to lay them in deep
cuttings, in which case cast-iron is much better adapted for
sustaining a heavy weight of earth than the thinner steel, though
the latter is more adapted to resist internal pressure. Mr
D. Clarke (<i>Trans. Am. Soc. C.E.</i> vol. xxxviii. p. 93) gives some
particulars of a riveted steel pipe 24 m. long, 33 to 42 in. diameter,
varying in thickness from 0.22 in. to 0.375 in. After a length of
9 m. had been laid, and the trench refilled, it was found that the
crown of the pipe had been flattened by an amount varying
from  ½ in. to 4 in. Steel pipes suffer more from corrosion
than those made of cast-iron, and as the metal attacked is
much thinner the strength is more seriously reduced. These
considerations have prevented any general change from cast-iron
to steel.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Mr. Clemens Herschel has made some interesting remarks (<i>Proc.
Inst. C.E.</i> vol. cxv. p. 162) as to the circumstances in which steel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
pipes have been found preferable to cast-iron. He says that it had
been demonstrated by practice that cast-iron cannot compete with
wrought-iron or steel pipes in the states west of the Rocky Mountains,
on the Pacific slope. This is due to the absence of coal and
iron ore in these states, and to the weight of the imported cast-iron
pipes compared with steel pipes of equal capacity and strength.
The works of the East Jersey Water Company for the supply of
Newark, N.J., include a riveted steel conduit 48 in. in diameter and
21 m. long. This conduit is designed to resist only the pressure due
to the hydraulic gradient, in contradistinction to that which would
be due to the hydrostatic head, this arrangement saving 40% in the
weight and cost of the pipes. For the supply of Rochester, N.Y.,
there is a riveted steel conduit 36 in. in diameter and 20 m. long;
and for Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, there is a steel conduit 5 ft. in
diameter and nearly 10 m. long. The works for bringing the water
from La Vigne and Verneuil to Paris include a steel main 5 ft. in
diameter between St. Cloud and Paris.</p>

<p>Cast-iron pipes rarely exceed 48 in. in diameter, and even this
diameter is only practicable where the pressure of the water is low.
In the Thirlmere aqueduct the greatest pressure is nearly 180 &#8468; on
the square inch, the pipes where this occurs being 40 in. in diameter
and 1¾ in. thick. These large pipes, which are usually made in
lengths of 12 ft., are generally cast with a socket at one end for
receiving the spigot end of the next pipe, the annular space being
run with lead, which is prevented from flowing into the interior of
the pipe by a spring ring subsequently removed; the surface of the
lead is then caulked all round the outside of the pipe. A wrought-iron
ring is sometimes shrunk on the outer rim of the socket, previously
turned to receive it, in order to strengthen it against the
wedging action of the caulking tool. Sometimes the pipes are cast
as plain tubes and joined with double collars, which are run with
lead as in the last case. The reason for adopting the latter type is
that the stresses set up in the thicker metal of the socket by unequal
cooling are thereby avoided, a very usual place for pipes to crack
under pressure being at the back of the socket. The method of
turning and boring a portion, slightly tapered, of spigot and socket
so as to ensure a watertight junction by close annular metallic contact,
is not suitable for large pipes, though very convenient for
smaller diameters in even ground. Spherical joints are sometimes
used where a line of main has to be laid under a large river or estuary,
and where, therefore, the pipes must be jointed before being lowered
into the previously dredged trench. This was the case at the Willamette
river, Portland, Oregon, where a length of 2000 ft. was required.
The pipes are of cast-iron 28 in. in diameter, 1½ in. thick, and 17 ft.
long. The spigots were turned to a spherical surface of 20 in.
radius outside, the inside of the sockets being of a radius <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in. greater.
After the insertion of the spigot into the socket, a ring, 3 in. deep,
turned inside to correspond with the socket, was bolted to the latter,
the annular space then being run with lead. These pipes were laid
on an inclined cradle, one end of which rested on the bed of the river
and the other on a barge where the jointing was done; as the pipes
were jointed the barge was carefully advanced, thus trailing the
pipes into the trench (<i>Trans. Am. Soc. C.E.</i> vol. xxxiii. p. 257). As
may be conjectured from the pressure which they have to stand,
very great care has to be taken in the manufacture and handling of
cast-iron pipes of large diameter, a care which must be unfailing
from the time of casting until they are jointed in their final position
in the ground. They are cast vertically, socket downwards, so that
the densest metal may be at the weakest part, and it is advisable to
allow an extra head of metal of about 12 in., which is subsequently
cut off in a lathe. An inspector representing the purchaser watches
every detail of the manufacture, and if, after being measured in
every part and weighed, they are found satisfactory they are proved
with internal fluid pressure, oil being preferable to water for this
purpose. While under pressure, they are rapped from end to end
with a hand hammer of about 5 &#8468; in weight, in order to discover
defects. The wrought-iron rings are then, if required, shrunk on
to the sockets, and the pipes, after being made hot in a stove, are
dipped vertically in a composition of pitch and oil, in order to
preserve them from corrosion. All these operations are performed
under cover. A record should be kept of the history of the pipe
from the time it is cast to the time it is laid and jointed in the ground,
giving the date, number, diameter, length, thickness, and proof
pressure, with the name of the pipe-jointer whose work closes the
record. Such a history sometimes enables the cause (which is often
very obscure) of a burst in a pipe to be ascertained, the position of
every pipe being recorded.</p>

<p>Cast-iron pipes, even when dipped in the composition referred to,
suffer considerably from corrosion caused by the water, especially
soft water, flowing through them. One pipe may be found in as
good a condition as when made, while the next may be covered with
nodules of rust. The effect of the rust is twofold; it reduces the
area of the pipe, and also, in consequence of the resistance offered
by the rough surface, retards the velocity of the water. These two
results, expecially the latter, may seriously diminish the capability
of discharge, and they should always be allowed for in deciding the
diameter. Automatic scrapers are sometimes used with good
results, but it is better to be independent of them as long as possible.
In one case the discharge of pipes, 40 in. in diameter, was found
after a period of about twelve years to have diminished at the rate
of about 1% per year; in another case, where the water was soft
and where the pipes were 40 in. in diameter, the discharge was
diminished by 7% in ten years. An account of the state of two
cast-iron mains supplying Boston with water is given in the <i>Trans.
Am. Soc. C.E.</i> vol. xxxv. p. 241. These pipes, which were laid in
1877, are 48 in. in diameter and 1800 ft. long. When they were
examined in 1894-1895, it was estimated that the tubercles of rust
covered nearly one-third of the interior surfaces, the bottom of the
pipe being more encrusted than the sides and top. They had central
points of attachment to the iron, at which no doubt the coating was
defective, and from them the tubercles spread over the surface of
the surrounding coating. In this case they were removed by hand,
and the coating of the pipes was not injured in the process. Cast-iron
pipes must not be laid in contact with cinders from a blast
furnace with which roads are sometimes made, because these corrode
the metal. Mr Russell Aitken (<i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> vol. cxv. p. 93)
found in India that cast-iron pipes buried in the soil rapidly corroded,
owing to the presence of nitric acid secreted by bacteria which
attacked the iron. The large cast-iron pipes conveying the water
from the Tansa reservoir to Bombay are laid above the surface of
the ground. Cast-iron pipes of these large diameters have not been
in existence sufficiently long to enable their life to be predicted. A
main, 40 in. in diameter, conveying soft water, after being in existence
fifty years at Manchester, was apparently as good as ever. In 1867
Mr J.B. Francis found that no apparent deterioration had taken
place in a cast-iron main, 8 in. diameter, which was laid in the year
1828, a period of thirty-nine years (<i>Trans. Soc. Am. C.E.</i> vol. i.
p. 26). These two instances are probably not exceptional.</p>
</div>

<p>Pipes in England are usually laid with not less than 2 ft. 6 in.
of cover, in order that the water may not be frozen in a severe
winter. Where they are laid in deep cutting they
should be partly surrounded with concrete, so that they
<span class="sidenote">Methods of laying.</span>
may not be fractured by the weight of earth above
them. Angles are turned by means of special bend pipes, the
curves being made of as large a radius as convenient. In the
case of the Thirlmere aqueduct, double socketed castings about
12 in. long (exclusive of the sockets) were used, the sockets
being inclined to each other at the required angle. They were
made to various angles, and for any particular curve several
would be used connected by straight pipes 3 ft. long. As special
castings are nearly double the price of the regular pipes, the
cost was much diminished by making them as short as possible,
while a curve, made up of the slight angles used, offered practically
no more impediment to the flow of water in consequence
of its polygonal form, than would be the case had special bend
pipes been used. In all cases of curves on a line of pipes under
internal fluid pressure, there exists a resultant force tending
to displace the pipes. When the curve is in a horizontal plane
and the pipes are buried in the ground, the side of the pipe
trench offers sufficient resistance to this force. Where, however,
the pipes are above ground, or when the curve is in a vertical
plane, it is necessary to anchor them in position. In the case of
the Tansa aqueduct to Bombay, there is a curve of 500 ft. radius
near Bassein Creek. At this point the hydrostatic head is about
250 ft., and the engineer, Mr Clerke, mentions that a tendency
to an outward movement of the line of pipes was observed. At
the siphon under Kurla Creek the curves on the approaches as
originally laid down were sharp, the hydrostatic head being there
about 210 ft.; here the outward movement was so marked that
it was considered advisable to realign the approaches with
easier curves (<i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> vol. cxv. p. 34). In the case of
the Thirlmere aqueduct the greatest hydrostatic pressure, 410 ft.,
occurs at the bridge over the river Lune, where the pipes are
40 in. in diameter, and in descending from the bridge make reverse
angles of 31½°. The displacing force at each of these angles
amounts to 54 tons, and as the design includes five lines of
pipes, it is obvious that the anchoring arrangements must be
very efficient. The steel straps used for anchoring these and all
other bends were curved to fit as closely as possible the castings
to be anchored. Naturally the metal was not in perfect contact,
but when the pipes were charged the disappearance of all the
slight inequalities showed that the straps were fulfilling their
intended purpose. At every summit on a line of pipes one or
more valves must be placed in order to allow the escape of
air, and they must also be provided on long level stretches,
and at changes of gradient where the depth of the point of
change below the hydraulic gradient is less than that at both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
sides, causing what may be called a virtual summit. It is better
to have too many than too few, as accumulations of air may
cause an enormous diminution in the quantity of water delivered.
In all depressions discharge valves should be placed for emptying
the pipes when desired, and for letting off the sediment which
accumulates at such points. Automatic valves are frequently
placed at suitable distances for cutting off the supply in case of
a burst. At the inlet mouth of the pipe they may depend for
their action on the sudden lowering of the water (due to a burst
in the pipe) in the chamber from which they draw their supply,
causing a float to sink and set the closing arrangement in motion.
Those on the line of main are started by the increased velocity in
the water, caused by the burst on the pipe at a lower level.
The water, when thus accelerated, is able to move a disk hung
in the pipe at the end of a lever and weighted so as to resist the
normal velocity; this lever releases a catch, and a door is then
gradually revolved by weights until it entirely closes the pipe.
Reflux valves on the ascending leg of a siphon prevent water
from flowing back in case of a burst below them; they have
doors hung on hinges, opening only in the normal direction of
flow. Due allowance must be made, in the amount of head
allotted to a pipe, for any head which may be absorbed by such
mechanical arrangements as those described where they offer
opposition to the flow of the water. These large mains require
most careful and gradual filling with water, and constant attention
must be given to the air-valves to see that the gutta-percha
balls do not wedge themselves in the openings. A large mass of
water, having a considerable velocity, may cause a great many
bursts by water-ramming, due to the admission of the water
at too great a speed. In places where iron is absent and timber
plentiful, as in some parts of America, pipes, even of large
diameter and in the most important cases, are sometimes made
of wooden staves hooped with iron. A description of two of
these will be found below.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Thirlmere Aqueduct</i> is capable of conveying 50,000,000
gallons a day from Thirlmere, in the English lake district, to Manchester.
The total length of 96 m. is made up of 14 m.
of tunnels, 37 m. of cut-and-cover, and 45 m. of cast-iron
<span class="sidenote">Thirlmere.</span>
pipes, five rows of the latter being required. The tunnels
where lined, and the cut-and-cover, are formed of concrete, and are
7 ft. in height and width, the usual thickness of the concrete being
15 in. The inclination is 20 in. per mile. The floor is flat from side
to side, and the side-walls are 5 ft. high to the springing of the arch,
which has a rise of 2 ft. The water from the lake is received in a
circular well 65 ft. deep and 40 ft. in diameter, at the bottom of
which there is a ring of wire-gauze strainers. Wherever the concrete
aqueduct is intersected by valleys, cast-iron pipes are laid;
in the first instance only two of the five rows 40 in. in diameter were
laid, the city not requiring its supply to be augmented by more than
20,000,000 gallons a day, but in 1907 it was decided to lay a third
line. All the elaborate arrangements described above for stopping
the water in case of a burst have been employed, and have perfectly
fulfilled their duties in the few cases in which they have been called
into action. The water is received in a service reservoir at Prestwich,
near Manchester, from which it is supplied to the city. The supply
from this source was begun in 1894. The total cost of the complete
scheme may be taken at about £5,000,000, of which rather under
£3,000,000 had been spent up to the date of the opening, at which
time only one line of pipes had been laid.</p>

<p>The <i>Vyrnwy Aqueduct</i> was sanctioned by parliament in 1880 for
the supply of Liverpool from North Wales, the quantity of water
obtainable being at least 40,000,000 gallons a day. A
tower built in the artificial lake from which the supply is
<span class="sidenote">Vyrnwy.</span>
derived, contains the inlet and arrangements for straining the water.
The aqueduct is 68 m. in length, and for nearly the whole distance
will consist of three lines of cast-iron pipes, two of which, varying in
diameter from 42 in. to 39 in., are now in use. As the total fall
between Vyrnwy and the termination at Prescot reservoirs is about
550 ft., arrangements had to be made to ensure that no part of the
aqueduct be subjected to a greater pressure than is required for the
actual discharge. Balancing reservoirs have therefore been constructed
at five points on the line, advantage being taken of high
ground where available, so that the total pressure is broken up into
sections. At one of these points, where the ground level is 110 ft.
below the hydraulic gradient, a circular tower is built, making a
most imposing architectural feature in the landscape. At the crossing
of the river Weaver, 100 ft. wide and 15 ft. deep, the three pipes,
here made of steel, were connected together laterally, floated into
position, and sunk into a dredged trench prepared to receive them.
Under the river Mersey the pipes are carried in a tunnel, from which,
during construction, the water was excluded by compressed air.</p>

<p><i>Denver Aqueduct.</i>&mdash;The supply to Denver City, initiated by the
Citizens Water Company in 1889, is derived from the Platte river,
rising in the Rocky Mountains. The first aqueduct
constructed is rather over 20 m. in length, of which a
<span class="sidenote">Denver.</span>
length of 16½ m. is made of wooden stave pipe, 30 in. in diameter.
The maximum pressure is that due to 185 ft. of water; the average
cost of the wooden pipe was $1.36½ per foot, and the capability of
discharge 8,400,000 gallons a day. Within a year of the completion
of the first conduit, it became evident that another of still greater
capacity was required. This was completed in April 1893; it is
34 in. in diameter and will deliver 16,000,000 gallons a day. By
increasing the head upon the first pipe, the combined discharge is
30,000,000 gallons a day. An incident in obtaining a temporary
supply, without waiting for the completion of the second pipe, was
the construction of two wooden pipes, 13 in. in diameter, crossing a
stream with a span of 104 ft., and having no support other than that
derived from their arched form. One end of the arch is 24½ ft.
above the other end, and, when filled with water, the deflection with
eight men on it was only <span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> of an inch. A somewhat similar arch,
60 ft. span, occurs on the 34-in. pipe where it crosses a canal.
Schuyler points out (<i>Trans. Am. Soc. C.E.</i> vol. xxxi. p. 148) that the
fact that the entire water supply of a city of 150,000 inhabitants
is conveyed in wooden mains, is so radical a departure from all
precedents, that it is deserving of more than a passing notice. He
says that it is manifestly and unreservedly successful, and has
achieved an enormous saving in cost. The sum saved by the use of
wooden, in preference to cast-iron pipes, is estimated at $1,100,000.
It is perhaps necessary to state that the pipe is buried in the ground
in the same way as metal pipes. The edges of the staves are dressed
to the radius with a minute tongue <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> in. high on one edge of each
stave, but with no corresponding groove in the next stave; its
object is to ensure a close joint when the bands are tightened up.
Leaks seldom or never occur along the longitudinal seams, but the
end shrinkage caused troublesome joint leaks. The shrinkage in
California redwood, which had seasoned 60 to 90 days before milling,
was frequently as much as 3 in. in the 20 staves that formed the
34-in. pipe, and the space so formed had to be filled by a special
closing stave. Metallic tongues, ¾ in. deep, are inserted at the ends
of abutting staves, in a straight saw cut. The bands, which are of
mild steel, have a head at one end and a nut and washer at the
other; the ends are brought together on a wrought-iron shoe,
against which the nut and washer set. The staves forming the lower
half of the pipe are placed on an outside, and the top staves on an
inside, mould. While the bands are being adjusted the pipe is
rounded out to bring the staves out full, and the staves are carefully
driven home on to the abutting staves. The spacing of the bands
depends on circumstances, but is about 150 bands per 100 ft. With
low heads the limit of spacing was fixed at 17 in. The outer surface
of the pipe, when charged, shows moisture oozing slightly over the
entire surface. This condition Schuyler considers an ideal one for
perfect preservation, and the staves were kept as thin as possible
to ensure its occurrence. Samples taken from pipes in use from
three to nine years are quite sound, and it is concluded that the wood
will last as long as cast-iron if the pipe is kept constantly charged.
The bands are the only perishable portion, and their life is taken at
from fifteen to twenty years. Other portions of the second conduit
for a length of nearly 3 m. were formed of concrete piping, 38 in.
diameter, formed on a mould in the trench, the thickness being 2½
to 3 in. So successful an instance of the use of wooden piping on a
large scale is sure to lead to a large development of this type of
aqueduct in districts where timber is plentiful and iron absent.</p>

<p><i>Pioneer Aqueduct, Utah.</i>&mdash;The construction of the Pioneer Aqueduct,
Utah, was begun in 1896 by the Pioneer Electric Power
Company, near the city of Ogden, 35 m. north of Salt
Lake City. The storage reservoir, from which it draws
<span class="sidenote">Pioneer, Utah.</span>
its water, will coyer an area of 2000 acres, and contain
about 15,000 million gallons of water. The aqueduct is a pipe 6 ft.
in diameter, and of a total length of 6 m.; for a distance of rather
more than 5 m. it is formed of wooden staves, the remainder, where
the head exceeds 117 ft., being of steel. It is laid in a trench and
covered to a depth of 3 ft. The greatest pressure on the steel pipe
is 200 &#8468; per sq. in., and the thickness varies from <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> to <span class="spp">11</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> in. The
pipe was constructed according to the usual practice of marine
boiler-work for high pressures, and each section, about 9 ft. long,
was dipped in asphalt for an hour. These sections were supported
on timber blocking, placed from 5 to 9 ft. apart, and consisting of
three to six pieces of 6 × 6 in. timbers laid one on the top of the other;
they were then riveted together in the ordinary way. The wooden
stave-pipe is of the type successfully used in the Western States for
many years, but its diameter is believed to be unequalled for any
but short lengths. There were thirty-two staves in the circle, 2 in.
in thickness, and about 20 ft. long, hooped with round steel rods <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in.
in diameter, each hoop being in two pieces. The pipe is supported
at intervals of 8 ft. by sills 6 × 8 in. and 8 ft. long. The flow through
it is 250 cubic ft. per second.</p>

<p>The <i>Santa Ana Canal</i> was constructed for irrigation purposes in
California, and is designed to carry 240 cub. ft. of water per second
(<i>Trans. Am. Soc. C.E.</i> vol. xxxiii. p. 99). The cross
section of the flumes shows an elliptical bottom and
<span class="sidenote">Santa Ana.</span>
straight sides consisting of wooden staves held together by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span>
iron and steel ribs. The width and depth are each 5 ft. 6 in., the
intended depth of water being 5 ft. The staves are held by T-iron
supports resting on wooden sills spaced 8 ft. apart, and are
compressed together by a framework. They were caulked with oakum,
on the top of which, to a third of the total depth, hot asphalt was
run. The use of nails was altogether avoided except in parts of the
framework, it being noticed that decay usually starts at nail-holes.
It was found possible to make the flume absolutely watertight, and
in case of repair being necessary at any part the framework is easily
taken to pieces so that new staves can be inserted. The water in the
flume has a velocity of 9.6 ft. per second. The Warm Springs, Deep,
and Morton cañons on the line are crossed by wooden stave pipes
52 in. in diameter, bound with round steel rods, and laid above the
surface of the ground. The work is planned for two rows of pipes,
each capable of carrying 123 cub. ft. per second; of these one so
far has been laid. The lengths of the pipes at each of the three
cañons are 551, 964 and 756 ft. respectively, and the maximum
head at any place is 160 ft. The pipes are not painted, and it has
been suggested that they would suffer in their exposed position in
case of a bush fire, a contingency to which, of course, flumes are also liable.</p>

<p><i>Aqueducts of New York.</i>&mdash;There are three aqueducts in New
York&mdash;the Old Croton Aqueduct (1837-1843), the Bronx River
Conduit (1880-1885), and the New Croton Aqueduct (1884-1893),
discharging respectively 95, 28, and 302 million U.S.
<span class="sidenote">New York.</span>
gallons a day; their combined delivery is therefore 425 million
gallons a day. The Old Croton Aqueduct is about 41 m. in length,
and was constructed as a masonry conduit, except at the Harlem
and Manhattan valleys, where two lines of 36-in. pipe were used.
The inclination of the former is at the rate of about 13 in. per
mile. The area of the cross-section is 53.34 sq. ft., the height
is 8½ ft., and the greatest width 7 ft. 5 in.; the roof is
semicircular, the floor segmental, and the sides have a batter
on the face of ½ in. per foot. The sides and invert are of
concrete, faced with 4 in. of brickwork, the roof being entirely
of brickwork. There is a bridge over the Harlem river 1450 ft.
in length, consisting of fifteen semicircular arches; its
soffit is 100 ft. above high water, and its cost was $963,427.
The construction of the New Croton Aqueduct was begun in 1885,
and the works were sufficiently advanced by the 15th of July
1890 to allow the supply to be begun. The lengths of the various
parts of the aqueduct are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">The length of tunnel under pressure (circular form) is 7.17 m., and
that not under pressure (horse-shoe form) 23.70 m. The maximum
pressure in the former is 55 &#8468; per sq. in. The width and height of
the horse-shoe form are each 13 ft. 7 in., and the diameter of the
circular form (with the exception of two short lengths) is 12 ft.
3 in. The reason for constructing the aqueduct in tunnel for so long a
distance was the enhanced value of the low-lying ground near the
old aqueduct. The tunnel deviates from a straight line only for the
purpose of intersecting a few transverse valleys at which it could be
emptied. For 25 m. the gradient is 0.7 foot per mile; the tunnel is
then depressed below the hydraulic gradient, the maximum depth
being at the Harlem river, where it is 300 ft. below high water. The
depth of the tunnel varies from 50 to 500 ft. from the surface of the
ground. Forty-two shafts were sunk to facilitate driving, and in
four cases where the surface of the ground is below the hydraulic
gradient these are closed by watertight covers. The whole of the
tunnel is lined with brickwork from 1 to 2 ft. in thickness, the voids
behind the lining being filled with rubble-in-mortar. The entry to
the old and new aqueducts is controlled by a gatehouse of elaborate
and massive design, and the pipes which take up the supply at the
end of the tunnel are also commanded by a gate-house. The aqueduct,
where it passes under the Harlem river, is worthy of special notice.
As it approaches the river it has a considerable fall, and eventually
ends in a vertical shaft 12 ft. 3 in. in diameter (where the water has
a fall of 174 ft.), from the bottom of which, at a depth of 300 ft.
below high-water level, the tunnel under the river starts. The latter
is circular in form, the diameter being 10 ft. 6 in., and the length
is 1300 ft.; it terminates at the bottom of another vertical shaft
also 12 ft. 3 in. in diameter. The depth of this shaft, measured from
the floor of the lower tunnel to that of the upper tunnel leading
away from it, is 321 ft.; it is continued up to the surface of the
ground, though closed by double watertight covers a little above
the level of the upper tunnel. Adjoining this shaft is another shaft
of equal diameter, by means of which the water can be pumped out,
and there is also a communication with the river above high-water
level, so that the higher parts can be emptied by gravitation. The
cost of the Old Croton Aqueduct was $11,500,000; that of the new
aqueduct is not far short of $20,000,000.</p>

<p>The <i>Nadrai Aqueduct Bridge</i>, in India, opened at the end of
1889, is the largest structure of its kind in existence. It was
built to carry the water of the Lower Ganges canal over the Kali Naddi, in
connexion with the irrigation canals of the north-west provinces.
<span class="sidenote">Nadrai.</span>
In the year 1888-1889 this canal had 564 m. of main line, with
2050 m. of minor distributaries, and irrigated 519,022 acres of crops.
The new bridge replaces one of much smaller size (five spans of 35
ft.), which was completely destroyed by a high flood in July 1885.
It gives the river a waterway of 21,000 sq. ft., and the canal a
waterway of 1040 sq. ft., the latter representing a discharge of
4100 cub. ft. per second. Its length is 1310 ft., and it is carried
on fifteen arches having a span of 60 ft. The width between the
faces of the arches is 149 ft. The foundations below the river-bed
have a depth of 52 ft., and the total height of the structure is 88 ft.
It cost 44½ lakhs of rupees, and occupied four years in building.
The foundations consist of 268 circular brick cylinders, and the
fifteen spans are arranged in three groups, divided by abutment
piers; the latter are founded on a double row of 12-ft. cylinders,
and the intermediate piers on a single row of 20-ft. cylinders, all
the cylinders being hearted with hydraulic lime concrete filled in
with skips. This aqueduct-bridge has a very fine appearance, owing
to its massive proportions and design.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;For ancient aqueducts in general: Curt Merckel, <i>Die
Ingenieurtechnik im Alterthum</i> (Berlin, 1899); ch. vi. contains a very
full account from the earliest Assyrian aqueducts onwards, with
illustrations, measurements and an excellent bibliography. For Greek

educated there and at Ulm (1502), in Italy (he met Erasmus in
Rome), at Bern (1508), Leipzig (1510) and Wittenberg (1513).
According to his son, he entered the ministry in August 1514,
at Bern. He was for some time a military chaplain. In 1516
he became pastor of Jenga, near Augsburg. Openly proclaiming
his adhesion to Luther&rsquo;s doctrine, he was imprisoned for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span>
half a year (1520 or 1522) at Dillingen, by order of the bishop
of Augsburg; a death sentence was commuted to banishment
through the influence of Isabella, wife of Christian II. of
Denmark and sister of Charles V. Returning to Wittenberg he
met Luther, acted as tutor to the sons of Franz von Sickingen
at Ebernburg, taught Hebrew at Wittenberg, and aided Luther
in his version of the Old Testament. The dates and particulars
of his career are uncertain till 1527, when he became pastor at
Saalfeld, and in 1528, superintendent. His vehement opposition
to the Augsburg Interim (1548) led him to take temporary
shelter at Rudolstadt with Catherine, countess of Schwarzburg.
In 1550 he was appointed dean of the Collegiatstift in
Schmalkalden. Here he had a controversy with Andreas Osiander.
Restored to Saalfeld, not without opposition, in 1552, he
remained there, still engaged in controversy, till his death on
the 12th of November 1560. He was twice married, and left
four sons. He published numerous sermons, a few Old Testament
expositions and some controversial tracts.</p>

which he took his name, and died in the year 1500. He spent
several years at the courts of Cardinal Sforza and Ferdinand,
duke of Calabria; but his principal patrons were the Borgias
at Rome, from whom he received many favours. Aquila seems
to have aimed at an imitation of Dante and Petrarch; and his
poems, which were extravagantly praised during the author&rsquo;s
lifetime, are occasionally of considerable merit. His reputation
was in great measure due to his remarkable skill as an
improvisatore and musician. His works were printed at Venice in

<p><span class="bold">AQUILA,<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> a city of the Abruzzi, Italy, the capital of the
province of Aquila, and the seat of an archbishop, 2360 ft. above
sea-level, 50 m. directly N.E. of Rome, and 145 m. by rail.
Pop. (1901) town, 18,494; commune, 21,261. It lies on a hill
in the wide valley of the Aterno, surrounded by mountains on
all sides, the Gran Sasso d&rsquo;Italia being conspicuous on the
north-east. It is a favourite summer resort of the Italians, but is
cold and windy in winter. In the highest part of the town is
the massive citadel, erected by the Spanish viceroy Don Pedro
de Toledo in 1534. The church of S. Bernardino di Siena (1472)
has a fine Renaissance façade by Nicolò Filotesio (commonly
called Cola dell&rsquo; Amatrice), and contains the monumental tomb
of the saint, decorated with beautiful sculptures, and executed
by Silvestro Ariscola in 1480. The church of S. Maria di
Collemaggio, just outside the town, has a very fine Romanesque
façade of simple design (1270-1280) in red and white marble,
with three finely decorated portals and a rose-window above
each. The two side doors are also fine. The interior contains
the mausoleum of Pope Celestine V. (d. 1296) erected in 1517.
Many smaller churches in the town have similar façades (S.
Giusta, S. Silvestro, &amp;c.). The town also contains some fine
palaces: the municipality has a museum, with a collection of
Roman inscriptions and some illuminated service books. The
Palazzi Dragonetti and Persichetti contain private collections
of pictures. Outside the town is the <i>Fontana delle novantanove
cannelle</i>, a fountain with ninety-nine jets distributed along three
walls, constructed in 1272. Aquila has some trade in lace and
saffron, and possesses other smaller industries. It was a university
town in the middle ages, but most of its chairs have now
been suppressed.</p>

<p>Aquila was founded by Conrad, son of the emperor
Frederick II., about 1250, as a bulwark against the power of
the papacy. It was destroyed by Manfred in 1259, but soon
rebuilt by Charles I. of Anjou. Its walls were completed in 1316;
and it maintained itself as an almost independent republic until
it was subdued in 1521 by the Spaniards, who had become
masters of the kingdom of Naples in 1503. It was twice sacked
by the French in 1799.</p>

<p><span class="bold">AQUILEIA,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> an ancient town of Italy, at the head of the
Adriatic at the edge of the lagoons, about 6 m. from the sea, on
the river Natiso (mod. Natisone), the course of which has changed
somewhat since Roman times. It was founded by the Romans
in 181 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> as a frontier fortress on the north-east, not far from
the site where, two years before, Gaulish invaders had attempted
to settle. The colony was led by two men of consular and one
of praetorian rank, and 3000 <i>pedites</i> formed the bulk of the
settlers. It was probably connected by road with Bononia in
175 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; and subsequently with Genua in 148 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by the Via
Postumia, which ran through Cremona, Bedriacum and Altinum,
joining the first-mentioned road at Concordia, while the
construction of the Via Popilia from Ariminum to Ad Portum near
Altinum in 132 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> improved the communications still further.
In 169 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, 1500 more families were settled there as a
reinforcement to the garrison. The discovery of the goldfields near
the modern Klagenfurt in 150 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (Strabo iv. 208) brought
it into notice, and it soon became a place of importance, not
only owing to its strategic position, but as a centre of trade,
especially in agricultural products. It also had, in later times
at least, considerable brickfields. It was originally a Latin
colony, but became a <i>municipium</i> probably in 90 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The
customs boundary of Italy was close by in Cicero&rsquo;s day. It was
plundered by the Iapydes under Augustus, but, in the period
of peace which followed, was able to develop its resources.
Augustus visited it during the Pannonian wars in 12-10 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
and it was the birthplace of Tiberius&rsquo;s son by Julia, in the latter
year. It was the starting-point of several important roads leading
to the north-eastern portion of the empire&mdash;the road (Via
Iulia Augusta) by Iulium Carnicum to Veldidena (mod. Wilten,
near Innsbruck), from which branched off the road into Noricum,
leading by Virunum (Klagenfurt) to Lauricum (Lorch) on the
Danube, the road into Pannonia, leading to Emona (Laibach)<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
and Sirmium (Mitrowitz), the road to Tarsatica (near Fiume)
and Siscia (Sissek), and that to Tergeste (Trieste) and the
Istrian coast.</p>

<p>In the war against the Marcomanni in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 167, the town
was hard pressed; the fortifications had fallen into disrepair
during the long peace. In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 238, when the town took the
side of the senate against the emperor Maximinus, they were
hastily restored, and proved of sufficient strength to resist for
several months, until Maximinus himself was assassinated.
The 4th century marks, however, the greatest importance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>
Aquileia; it became a naval station and, probably, the seat of
the <i>corrector Venetiarum et Histriae</i>; a mint was established here,
the coins of which are very numerous, and the bishop obtained
the rank of patriarch. An imperial palace was constructed here,
in which the emperors after the time of Diocletian frequently
resided; and the city often played a part in the struggles
between the rulers of the 4th century. At the end of the century,
Ausonius enumerated it as the ninth among the great cities of
the world, placing Rome, Mediolanum and Capua before it, and
called it &ldquo;moenibus et portu celeberrima.&rdquo; In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 452, however,
it was destroyed by Attila, though it continued to exist
until the Lombard invasion of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 568. After this the patriarchate
was transferred to Grado. In 606 the diocese was
divided into two parts, and the patriarchate of Aquileia, protected
by the Lombards, was revived, that of Grado being
protected by the exarch of Ravenna and later by the doges of
Venice. In 1027 and 1044 Patriarch Poppo of Aquileia entered
and sacked Grado, and, though the pope reconfirmed the patriarch
of the latter in his dignities, the town never recovered,
though it continued to be the seat of the patriarchate until its
formal transference to Venice in 1450. The seat of the patriarchate
of Aquileia had been transferred to Udine in 1238, but
returned in 1420 when Venice annexed the territory of Udine.
It was finally suppressed in 1751, and the sees of Udine and
Gorizia (Görz) established in its stead. Its buildings served as
stone quarries for centuries, and no edifices of the Roman period
remain above ground. Excavations have revealed one street
and the north-west angle of the town walls, while the local
museum contains over 2000 inscriptions, besides statues and
other antiquities. The cathedral, a flat-roofed basilica, was
erected by Patriarch Poppo in 1031 on the site of an earlier
church, and rebuilt about 1379 in the Gothic style by Patriarch
Marquad. The narthex and baptistery belong to an earlier
period. Of the palace of the patriarchs only two isolated
columns remain standing. The modern village (pop. 2300) is
rendered unhealthy by rice-fields.</p>

<p><span class="bold">AQUINAS, THOMAS<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Thomas of Aquin</span> or <span class="sc">Aquino</span>], (<i>c.</i> 1227-1274),
scholastic philosopher, known as <i>Doctor Angelicus, Doctor
Universalis</i>, was of noble descent, and nearly allied to several of
the royal houses of Europe. He was born in 1225 or 1227, at
Roccasecca, the castle of his father Landulf, count of Aquino,
in the territories of Naples. Having received his elementary
education at the monastery of Monte Cassino, he studied for six
years at the university of Naples, leaving it in his sixteenth year.
While there he probably came under the influence of the Dominicans,
who were doing their utmost to enlist within their ranks
the ablest young scholars of the age, for in spite of the opposition
of his family, which was overcome only by the intervention of
Pope Innocent IV., he assumed the habit of St Dominic in his
seventeenth year.</p>

<p>His superiors, seeing his great aptitude for theological study,
sent him to the Dominican school in Cologne, where Albertus
Magnus was lecturing on philosophy and theology. In 1245
Albertus was called to Paris, and there Aquinas followed him,
and remained with him for three years, at the end of which he
graduated as bachelor of theology. In 1248 he returned to
Cologne with Albertus, and was appointed second lecturer and
<i>magister studentium</i>. This year may be taken as the beginning
of his literary activity and public life. Before he left Paris he
had thrown himself with ardour into the controversy raging
between the university and the Friar-Preachers respecting the
liberty of teaching, resisting both by speeches and pamphlets the
authorities of the university; and when the dispute was referred
to the pope, the youthful Aquinas was chosen to defend his
order, which he did with such success as to overcome the arguments
of Guillaume de St Amour, the champion of the university,
and one of the most celebrated men of the day. In 1257, along
with his friend Bonaventura, he was created doctor of theology,
and began to give courses of lectures upon this subject in Paris,
and also in Rome and other towns in Italy. From this time
onwards his life was one of incessant toil; he was continually
engaged in the active service of his order, was frequently travelling
upon long and tedious journeys, and was constantly consulted
on affairs of state by the reigning pontiff.</p>

<p>In 1263 we find him at the chapter of the Dominican order
held in London. In 1268 he was lecturing now in Rome and
now in Bologna, all the while engaged in the public business of
the church. In 1271 he was again in Paris, lecturing to the
students, managing the affairs of the church and consulted by
the king, Louis VIII., his kinsman, on affairs of state. In 1272
the commands of the chief of his order and the request of King
Charles brought him back to the professor&rsquo;s chair at Naples.
All this time he was preaching every day, writing homilies,
disputations, lectures, and finding time to work hard at his great
work the <i>Summa Theologiae</i>. Such rewards as the church could
bestow had been offered to him. He refused the archbishopric of
Naples and the abbacy of Monte Cassino. In January 1274 he
was summoned by Pope Gregory X. to attend the council convened
at Lyons, to investigate and if possible settle the differences
between the Greek and Latin churches. Though suffering from
illness, he at once set out on the journey; finding his strength
failing on the way, he was carried to the Cistercian monastery of
Fossa Nuova, in the diocese of Terracina, where, after a lingering
illness of seven weeks, he died on the 7th of March 1274, Dante
(<i>Purg</i>. xx. 69) asserts that he was poisoned by order of Charles
of Anjou. Villani (ix. 218) quotes the belief, and the <i>Anonimo
Fiorentino</i> describes the crime and its motive. But Muratori,
reproducing the account given by one of Thomas&rsquo;s friends,
gives no hint of foul play. Aquinas was canonized in 1323 by
Pope John XXII., and in 1567 Pius V. ranked the festival of St
Thomas with those of the four great Latin fathers, Ambrose,
Augustine, Jerome and Gregory. No theologian save Augustine
has had an equal influence on the theological thought and
language of the Western Church, a fact which was strongly
emphasized by Leo XIII. (<i>q.v.</i>) in his <i>Encyclical</i> of August 4,
1879, which directed the clergy to take the teachings of Aquinas
as the basis of their theological position. In 1880 he was declared
patron of all Roman Catholic educational establishments. In a
monastery at Naples, near the cathedral of St Januarius, is still
shown a cell in which he is said to have lived.</p>

<p>The writings of Thomas are of great importance for philosophy
as well as for theology, for by nature and education he is the spirit
of scholasticism incarnate. The principles on which his system
rested were these. He held that there were two sources of
knowledge&mdash;the mysteries of Christian faith and the truths of
human reason. The distinction between these two was made
emphatic by Aquinas, who is at pains, especially in his treatise
<i>Contra Gentiles</i>, to make it plain that each is a distinct fountain
of knowledge, but that revelation is the more important of the
two. Revelation is a source of knowledge, rather than the
manifestation in the world of a divine life, and its chief characteristic
is that it presents men with mysteries, which are to be
believed even when they cannot be understood. Revelation is
not Scripture alone, for Scripture taken by itself does not correspond
exactly with his description; nor is it church tradition
alone, for church tradition must so far rest on Scripture. Revelation
is a divine source of knowledge, of which Scripture and
church tradition are the channels; and he who would rightly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>
understand theology must familiarize himself with Scripture,
the teachings of the fathers, and the decisions of councils, in such
a way as to be able to make part of himself, as it were, those
channels along which this divine knowledge flowed. Aquinas&rsquo;s
conception of reason is in some way parallel with his conception
of revelation. Reason is in his idea not the individual reason,
but the fountain of natural truth, whose chief channels are the
various systems of heathen philosophy, and more especially the
thoughts of Plato and the methods of Aristotle. Reason and
revelation are separate sources of knowledge; and man can put
himself in possession of each, because he can bring himself into
relation to the church on the one hand, and the system of philosophy,
or more strictly Aristotle, on the other. The conception
will be made clearer when it is remembered that Aquinas, taught
by the mysterious author of the writings of the pseudo-Dionysius,
who so marvellously influenced medieval writers, sometimes
spoke of a natural revelation, or of reason as a source of truths
in themselves mysterious, and was always accustomed to say
that reason as well as revelation contained two kinds of knowledge.
The first kind lay quite beyond the power of man to
receive it, the second was within man&rsquo;s reach. In reason, as in
revelation, man can only attain to the lower kind of knowledge;
there is a higher kind which we may not hope to reach.</p>

<p>But while reason and revelation are two distinct sources
of truths, the truths are not contradictory; for in the last
resort they rest on <i>one</i> absolute truth&mdash;they come from the one
source of knowledge, God, the Absolute One. Hence arises the
compatibility of philosophy and theology which was the fundamental
axiom of scholasticism, and the possibility of a Summa
Theologiae, which is a Summa Philosophiae as well. All the
many writings of Thomas are preparatory to his great work the
<i>Summa Theologiae</i>, and show us the progress of his mind training
for this his life work. In the <i>Summa Catholicae Fidei contra
Gentiles</i> he shows how a Christian theology is the sum and crown
of all science. This work is in its design apologetic, and is meant
to bring within the range of Christian thought all that is of value
in Mahommedan science. He carefully establishes the necessity
of revelation as a source of knowledge, not merely because it
aids us in comprehending in a somewhat better way the truths
already furnished by reason, as some of the Arabian philosophers
and Maimonides had acknowledged, but because it is the absolute
source of our knowledge of the mysteries of the Christian faith;
and then he lays down the relations to be observed between
reason and revelation, between philosophy and theology. This
work, <i>Contra Gentiles</i>, may be taken as an elaborate exposition
of the method of Aquinas. That method, however, implied a
careful study and comprehension of the results which accrued
to man from reason and revelation, and a thorough grasp of
all that had been done by man in relation to those two sources
of human knowledge; and so, in his preliminary writings,
Thomas proceeds to master the two provinces. The results of
revelation he found in the Holy Scriptures and in the writings
of the fathers and the great theologians of the church; and
his method was to proceed backwards. He began with
Peter of Lombardy (who had reduced to theological order, in
his famous book on the <i>Sentences</i>, the various authoritative
statements of the church upon doctrine) in his <i>In Quatuor
Sententiarum P. Lombardi libros</i>. Then came his deliverances
upon undecided points in theology, in his <i>XII. Quodlibeta
Disputata</i>, and his <i>Quaestiones Disputatae</i>. His <i>Catena Aurea</i>
next appeared, which, under the form of a commentary on the
Gospels, was really an exhaustive summary of the theological
teaching of the greatest of the church fathers. This side of his
preparation was finished by a close study of Scripture, the
results of which are contained in his commentaries, <i>In omnes
Epistolas Dim Apostoli Expositio</i>, his <i>Super Isaiam et Jeremiam</i>,
and his <i>In Psalmos</i>. Turning now to the other side, we have
evidence, not only from tradition but from his writings, that
he was acquainted with Plato and the mystical Platonists;
but he had the sagacity to perceive that Aristotle was <i>the</i> great
representative of philosophy, and that his writings contained
the best results and method which the natural reason had as yet
attained to. Accordingly Aquinas prepared himself on this side
by commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>De Interpretatione</i>, on his <i>Posterior
Analytics</i>, on the <i>Metaphysics</i>, the <i>Physics</i>, the <i>De Anima</i>, and
on Aristotle&rsquo;s other psychological and physical writings, each
commentary having for its aim to lay hold of the material and
grasp the method contained and employed in each treatise.
Fortified by this exhaustive preparation, Aquinas began his
<i>Summa Theologiae</i>, which he intended to be the sum of all known
learning, arranged according to the best method, and subordinate
to the dictates of the church. Practically it came to be
the theological dicta of the church, explained according to the
philosophy of Aristotle and his Arabian commentators. The
<i>Summa</i> is divided into three great parts, which shortly may be
said to treat of God, Man and the God-Man. The first and the
second parts are wholly the work of Aquinas, but of the third
part only the first ninety quaestiones are his; the rest of it was
finished in accordance with his designs. The first book, after
a short introduction upon the nature of theology as understood
by Aquinas, proceeds in 119 questions to discuss the nature,
attributes and relations of God; and this is not done as in a
modern work on theology, but the questions raised in the physics
of Aristotle find a place alongside of the statements of Scripture,
while all subjects in any way related to the central theme are
brought into the discourse. The second part is divided into
two, which are quoted as <i>Prima Secundae</i> and <i>Secunda Secundae</i>.
This second part has often been described as ethic, but this is
scarcely true. The subject is man, treated as Aristotle does,
according to his <span class="grk" title="telos">&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, and so Aquinas discusses all the ethical,
psychological and theological questions which arise; but any
theological discussion upon man must be mainly ethical, and so
a great proportion of the first part, and almost the whole of the
second, has to do with ethical questions. In his ethical discussions
(a full account of which is given under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ethics</a></span>) Aquinas
distinguishes theological from natural virtues and vices; the
theological virtues are faith, hope and charity; the natural,
justice, prudence and the like. The theological virtues are
founded on faith, in opposition to the natural, which are founded
on reason; and as faith with Aquinas is always belief in a proposition,
not trust in a personal Saviour, conformably with his
idea that revelation is a new knowledge rather than a new life,
the relation of unbelief to virtue is very strictly and narrowly
laid down and enforced. The third part of the <i>Summa</i> is also
divided into two parts, but by accident rather than by design.
Aquinas died ere he had finished his great work, and what has
been added to complete the scheme is appended as a <i>Supplementum
Tertiae Partis</i>. In this third part Aquinas discusses
the person, office and work of Christ, and had begun to discuss
the sacraments, when death put an end to his labours.</p>

<p>The purely philosophical theories of Aquinas are explained
in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Scholasticism</a></span>. In connexion with the problem
of universals, he held that the diversity of individuals depends
on the quantitative division of matter (<i>materia signata</i>), and
in this way he attracted the criticism of the Scotists, who pointed
out that this very matter is individual and determinate, and,
therefore, itself requires explanation. In general, Aquinas
maintained in different senses the real existence of universals
<i>ante rem</i>, <i>in re</i> and <i>post rem</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">AQUITAINE,<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> the name of an ancient province in France, the
extent of which has varied considerably from time to time.
About the time of Julius Caesar the name <i>Aquitania</i> was given
to that part of Gaul lying between the Pyrenees and the Garonne,
and its inhabitants were a race, or races, distinct from the Celts.
The name Aquitania is probably a form of Auscetani, which in
its turn is a lengthened form of Ausces, and is thus cognate with
the words Basque and Wasconia, <i>i.e.</i> Gascony. Although many
of the tribes of Aquitania submitted to Julius Caesar, it was not
until about 28 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> that the district was brought under the
Roman yoke. In keeping with the Roman policy of denationalization,
the term Aquitania was extended, and under Augustus
it included the whole of Gaul south and west of the Loire and
the Allier, and thus ceased to possess ethnographical importance.
In the 3rd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> this larger Aquitania was divided into
three parts: <i>Aquitania Prima</i>, the eastern part of the district
between the Loire and the Garonne; <i>Aquitania Secunda</i>, the
western part of the same district; and <i>Aquitania Tertia</i>, or
<i>Novempopulana</i>, the region between the Garonne and the
Pyrenees, or the original Aquitania. The seats of government
were respectively Bourges, Bordeaux and Eauze; the province
contained twenty-six cities, and was in the diocese of Vienne.
Like the rest of Gaul, Aquitania absorbed a large measure of
Roman civilization, and this continued to distinguish the district
down to a late period. In the 5th century the Visigoths
established themselves in Aquitania Secunda, and also in parts
of Aquitania Prima and Novempopulana, but after the defeat
of their king Alaric II. by the Franks under Clovis in 507, they
were supplanted by their conquerors. Clovis and his successors
extended their authority nominally to the Pyrenees, but, as
Guizot has remarked, &ldquo;the conquest of Aquitania by Clovis left
it almost as alien to the people and king of Franks as it had
formerly been.&rdquo; Subsequently during the Merovingian period
it was contended for by the feeble rulers of the various Frankish
kingdoms, and was frequently partitioned among them; but
the Aquitanians had little difficulty in effectually resisting this
authority, although they did not establish themselves as a separate
kingdom. About 628, indeed, they gathered around Charibert,
or Haribert, a brother of the Frankish king, Dagobert I., in the
hope of national independence; but after his death in 630 they
returned to their former condition. But this effort, although
a failure, brought about a certain measure of concord between
the two principal races inhabiting the district, and so prepared
the way for the stubborn resistance which, subsequently, the
Aquitanians were able to offer to the Franks.</p>

<p>The first line of dukes began about 660 with one Felix, who,
like his successor, Lupus, probably owned allegiance to the
Frankish kings, and whose seat of government was Toulouse.
About the end of the 7th century an adventurer named Odo,
or Eudes, made himself master of this region. Attacked by the
Saracens he inflicted on them a crushing defeat, but when they
reappeared, he was obliged to invoke the aid of Charles Martel,
who, as the price of his support, claimed and received the homage
of his ally. Odo was succeeded by his son Hunald, who after
carrying on a war against the Franks under Pippin the Short,
retired to a convent, leaving both the kingdom and the conflict
to Waifer, or Guaifer. For some years Waifer strenuously
carried on an unequal struggle with the Franks, but he was
assassinated in 768, and with him perished the national independence,
although not the national individuality, of the
Aquitanians. In 781 Charlemagne bestowed Aquitaine upon his
young son, Louis, and as Louis was generally described as a
king, Aquitaine is referred to during the Carolingian period
as a kingdom, and not as a duchy. When Louis succeeded
Charlemagne as emperor in 814, he granted Aquitaine to his
son Pippin, on whose death in 838 the Aquitanians chose his
son Pippin II. (d. 865) as their king. The emperor Louis I.,
however, opposed this arrangement and gave the kingdom to
his youngest son Charles, afterwards the emperor Charles the
Bald. Now followed a time of confusion and conflict which
resulted eventually in the success of Charles, although from
845 to 852 Pippin was in possession of the kingdom. In 852
Pippin was imprisoned by Charles the Bald, who soon afterwards
gave to the Aquitanians his own son Charles as their king.
On the death of the younger Charles in 866, his brother Louis
the Stammerer succeeded to the kingdom, and when, in 877,
Louis became king of the Franks, Aquitaine was united to the
Frankish crown.</p>

<p>A new period now begins in the history of Aquitaine. By a
treaty made in 845 between Charles the Bald and Pippin II.
the kingdom had been diminished by the loss of Poitou, Saintonge
and Angoumois, which had been given to Rainulf I., count
of Poitiers. Somewhat earlier than this date the title of duke
of the Aquitanians had been revived, and this was now borne
by Rainulf, although it was also claimed by the counts of
Toulouse. The new duchy of Aquitaine, comprising the three districts
already mentioned, remained in the hands of Rainulf&rsquo;s
successors, in spite of some trouble with their Frankish overlords,
until 893 when Count Rainulf II. was poisoned by order
of King Charles III. the Simple. Charles then bestowed the
duchy upon William the Pious, count of Auvergne, the founder
of the abbey of Cluny, who was succeeded in 918 by his nephew,
Count William II., who died in 926. A succession of dukes
followed, one of whom, William IV., fought against Hugh Capet,
king of France, and another of whom, William V., called the
Great, was able considerably to strengthen and extend his
authority, although he failed in his attempt to secure the Lombard
crown. William&rsquo;s duchy almost reached the limits of
the Roman Aquitania Prima and Secunda, but did not stretch
south of the Garonne, a district which was in the possession
of the Gascons. William died in 1030, and the names of
William VI. (d. 1038), Odo or Eudes (d. 1039), who joined Gascony
to his duchy, William VII. and William VIII. bring us down to
William IX. (d. 1127), who succeeded in 1087, and made himself
famous as a crusader and a troubadour. William X. (d. 1137)
married his daughter Eleanor to Louis VII., king of France,
and Aquitaine went as her dowry. When Eleanor was divorced
from Louis and was married in 1152 to Henry II. of England
the duchy passed to her new husband, who, having suppressed
a revolt there, gave it to his son Richard. When Richard died
in 1199, it reverted to Eleanor, and on her death five years later,
was united to the English crown and henceforward followed
the fortunes of the English possessions in France. Aquitaine
as it came to the English kings stretched as of old from the
Loire to the Pyrenees, but its extent was curtailed on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
south-east by the wide lands of the counts of Toulouse. The name
Guienne, a corruption of Aquitaine, seems to have come into
use about the 10th century, and the subsequent history of
Aquitaine is merged in that of Gascony (<i>q.v.</i>) and Guienne (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARABESQUE,<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> a word meaning simply &ldquo;Arabian,&rdquo; but
technically used for a certain form of decorative design in
flowing lines intertwined; hence comes the more metaphorical
use of this word, whether in nature or in morals, indicating a
fantastic or complicated interweaving of lines against a background.
In decorative design the term is historically a
misnomer. It is applied to the grotesque decoration derived from
Roman remains of the early time of the empire, not to any style
derived from Arabian or Moorish work. Arabesque and Moresque
are really distinct; the latter is from the Arabian style of ornament,
developed by the Byzantine Greeks for their new masters,
after the conquests of the followers of Mahomet; and the former
is a term pretty well restricted to varieties of cinquecento decoration,
which have nothing in common with any Arabian
examples in their details, but are a development derived from
Greek and Roman grotesque designs, such as we find them in
the remains of ancient palaces at Rome, and in ancient houses
at Pompeii. These were reproduced by Raphael and his pupils
in the decoration of some of the corridors of the Loggie of the
Vatican at Rome: grotesque is thus a better name for these
decorations than Arabesque. This technical Arabesque, therefore,
is much more ancient than any Arabian or Moorish decoration,
and has really nothing in common with it except the mere
symmetrical principles of its arrangement. Pliny and Vitruvius
give us no name for the extravagant decorative wall-painting
in vogue in their time, to which the early Italian revivers of it
seem to have given the designation of grotesque, because it, was
first discovered in the arched or underground chambers (<i>grotte</i>)
of Roman ruins&mdash;as in the golden house of Nero, or the baths of
Titus. What really took place in the Italian revival was in some
measure a supplanting of the Arabesque for the classical
grotesque, still retaining the original Arabian designation, while
the genuine Arabian art, the Saracenic, was distinguished as
Moresque or Moorish. So it is now the original Arabesque that
is called by its specific names of Saracenic, Moorish and Alhambresque,
while the term Arabesque is applied exclusively to the
style developed from the debased classical grotesque of the
Roman empire.</p>

<p>There is still much of the genuine Saracenic element in Renaissance
Arabesques, especially in that selected for book-borders
and for silver-work, the details of which consist largely of the
conventional Saracenic foliations. But the Arabesque developed
in the Italian cinquecento work repudiated all the original
Arabian elements and devices, and limited itself to the manipulating
of the classical elements, of which the most prominent
feature is ever the floriated or foliated scroll; and it is in this
cinquecento decoration, whether in sculpture or in painting,
that <i>Arabesque</i> has been perfected.</p>

<p>In the Saracenic, as the elder sister of the two styles, which
was ingeniously developed by the Byzantine Greek artists for their
Arabian masters in the early times of Mahommedan conquest,
every natural object was proscribed; the artists were, therefore,
reduced to making symmetrical designs from forms which should
have no positive meaning; yet the Byzantine Greeks, who were
Christians, managed to work even their own ecclesiastical
symbols, in a disguised manner, into their tracery and diapers;
as the lily, for instance. The cross was not so introduced; this,
of course, was inadmissible; but neither was the crescent ever
introduced into any of this early work in Damascus or Cairo.
The crescent was itself not a Mahommedan device till after the
conquest of Constantinople in 1453 <span class="scs">A.D.</span> The crescent, as the
new moon, was the symbol of Byzantium; and it was only after
that capital of the Eastern empire fell into the hands of the Turks
that this symbol was adopted by them. The crescent and the
cross became antagonist standards, therefore, first in the 15th
century. And the crescent is not an element of original Moorish
decoration.</p>

<p>The Alhambra diapers and original Majolica (Majorca) ware
afford admirable specimens of genuine Saracenic or Moorish
decoration. A conventional floriage is common in these diapers;
tracery also is a great feature in this work, in geometrical combinations,
whether rectilinear or curvilinear; and the designs
are rich in colour; idolatry was in the reproduction of natural
forms, not in the fanciful combination of natural colours. These
curves and angles, therefore, or interlacings, chiefly in stucco,
constitute the prominent elements of an Arabian ornamental
design, combining also Arabic inscriptions; composed of a mass
of foliation or floral forms conventionally disguised, as the exclusion
of all natural images was the fundamental principle of
the style in its purity. The Alhambra displays almost endless
specimens of this peculiar work, all in relief, highly coloured,
and profusely enriched with gold. The mosque of Tulun, in
Cairo, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 876, the known work of a Greek, affords the
completest example of this art in its early time; and Sicily
contains many remains of this same exquisite Saracenic
decoration.</p>

<p>Such is the genuine Arabesque of the Arabs, but a very
different style of design is implied by the Arabesque of the
cinquecento, a purely classical ornamentation. This owes its
origin to the excavation and recovery of ancient monuments,
and was developed chiefly by the sculptors of the north, and the
painters of central Italy; by the Lombardi of Venice, by
Agostino Busti of Milan, by Bramante of Urbino, by Raphael,
by Giulio Romano, and others of nearly equal merit. Very
beautiful examples in sculpture of this cinquecento Arabesque
are found in the churches of Venice, Verona and Brescia; in
painting, the most complete specimens are those of the Vatican
Loggie, and the Villa Madama at Rome and the ducal palaces
at Mantua. The Vatican Arabesques, chiefly executed for
Raphael by Giulio Romano, Gian Francesco Penni, and Giovanni
da Udine, though beautiful as works of painting, are often
very extravagant in their composition, ludicrous and sometimes
aesthetically offensive; as are also many of the decorations of
Pompeii. The main features of these designs are balanced
scrolls in panels; or standards variously composed, but symmetrically
scrolled on either side, and on the tendrils of these
scrolls are suspended or placed birds and animals, human figures
and chimeras, of any or all kinds, or indeed any objects that may
take the fancy of the artist. The most perfect specimens of
cinquecento Arabesque are certainly found in sculpture. As
specimens of exquisite work may be mentioned the Martinengo
tomb, in the church of the Padri Riformati at Brescia, and the
façade of the church of Santa Maria del Miracoli there, by
the Lombardi; and many of the carvings of the Château de
Gaillon, France&mdash;all of which fairly illustrate the beauties and
capabilities of the style.</p>

the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb (or Bab al Mandab) to Ras el Had
is 1300 m., its northern side from Port Said to the Euphrates
600 m.; its total area approximately 1,200,000 sq. m.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Geography</p>

<p><i>General Features.</i>&mdash;In general terms Arabia may be described
as a plateau sloping gently from south-west to north-east, and
attaining its greatest elevation in the extreme south-west.
The western escarpment of the plateau rises steeply from the
Red Sea littoral to a height of from 4000 to 8000 ft., leaving a
narrow belt of lowland rarely exceeding 30 m. in width between
the shore and the foot-hills. On the north-east and east the
plateau shelves gradually to the Euphrates and the Persian Gulf;
only in the extreme east is this general easterly slope arrested by
the lofty range of Jebel Akhdar, which from Ras Musandan to
Ras el Had borders the coast of Oman.</p>

<p>Its chief characteristic is the bareness and aridity of its surface;
one-third of the whole desert, and of the remainder only
a small proportion is suited to settled life, owing to its scanty
water-supply and uncertain rainfall. Its mountains are insufficient
in elevation and extent to attract their full share of
the monsoon rains, which fall so abundantly on the Abyssinian
highlands on the other side of the Red Sea; for this reason Arabia
has neither lakes nor forests to control the water-supply and
prevent its too rapid dissipation, and the rivers are mere torrent
beds sweeping down occasionally in heavy floods, but otherwise
dry.</p>

<p>The country falls naturally into three main divisions, a
northern, a central and a southern; the first includes the area
between the Midian coast on the west and the head of the Persian
Gulf on the east, a desert tract throughout, stony in the north,
sandy in the south, but furnishing at certain seasons excellent
pasturage; its population is almost entirely nomad and pastoral.
The central zone includes Hejaz (or Hijaz), Nejd and El Hasa;
much of it is a dry, stony or sandy steppe, with few wells or
watering-places, and only occupied by nomad tribes; but the
great wadis which intersect it contain many fertile stretches of
alluvial soil, where cultivation is possible and which support a
considerable settled population, with several large towns and
numerous villages.</p>

<p>The third or southern division contains the highland plateaus
of Asir and Yemen in the west, and J. Akhdar in the east,
which with a temperate climate, due to their great elevation and
their proximity to the sea, deserve, if any part of Arabia does,
the name of Arabia Felix&mdash;the population is settled and agricultural,
and the soil, wherever the rainfall is sufficient, is productive.
The Batina coast of Oman, irrigated by the mountain
streams of J. Akhdar, is perhaps the most fertile district in the
peninsula; Hadramut, too, contains many large and prosperous
villages, and the torrents from the Yemen highlands fertilize
several oases in the Tehama (or Tihama) or lowlands of the
western and southern coast. These favourable conditions of soil
and climate, however, extend only a comparatively short distance
into the interior, by far the larger part of which is covered by
the great southern desert, the Dahna, or Ruba el Khali, empty
as its name implies, and uninhabitable.</p>

<p><i>Exploration.</i>&mdash;Before entering on a detailed description of the
several provinces of Arabia, our sources of information will be
briefly indicated. Except in the neighbourhood of Aden, no
regular surveys exist, and professional work is limited to the
marine surveys of the Indian government and the admiralty,
which, while laying down the coast line with fair accuracy, give
little or no topographical information inland. For the mapping of
the whole vast interior, except in rare cases, no data exist beyond
the itineraries of explorers, travelling as a rule under conditions
which precluded the use of even the simplest surveying instruments.
These journeys, naturally following the most frequented
routes, often cover the same ground, while immense tracts, owing
to their difficulty of access, remain unvisited by any European.</p>

<p>The region most thoroughly explored is Yemen, in the south-west
corner of the peninsula, where the labours of a succession
of travellers from Niebuhr in 1761 to E. Glaser and R. Manzoni in
1887 have led to a fairly complete knowledge of all that part of
the province west of the capital Sana; while in 1902-1904 the
operations of the Anglo-Turkish boundary commission permitted
the execution of a systematic topographical survey of the British
protectorate from the Red Sea to the Wadi Bana, 30 m. east of
Aden. North of Yemen up to the Hejaz border the only
authority is that of E.F. Jomard&rsquo;s map, published in 1839,
based on the information given by the French officers employed
with Ibrahim Pasha&rsquo;s army in Asir from 1824 to 1827, and of
J. Halévy in Nejran. On the south coast expeditions have
penetrated but a short distance, the most notable exceptions
being those of L. Hirsch and J.T. Bent in 1887 to the Hadramut
valley. S.B. Miles, J.R. Wellsted, and S.M. Zwemer have
explored Oman in the extreme east; but the interior south of a
line drawn from Taif to El Katr on the Persian Gulf is still
virgin ground. In northern Arabia the Syrian desert and the
great Nafud (Nefud) have been crossed by several travellers,
though a large area remains unexplored in the north-east between
Kasim and the gulf. In the centre, the journeys of W. Palgrave,
C. Doughty, W. Blunt and C. Huber have done much to elucidate
the main physical features of the country. Lastly, in the north-west
the Sinai peninsula has been thoroughly explored, and the
list of travellers who have visited the Holy Cities and traversed
the main pilgrim routes through Hejaz is a fairly long one,
though, owing to the difficulties peculiar to that region, the
hydrography of southern Hejaz is still incompletely known.</p>

<p>The story of modern exploration begins with the despatch
of C. Niebuhr&rsquo;s mission by the Danish government in 1761.
After a year spent in Egypt and the Sinai peninsula
the party reached Jidda towards the end of 1762, and
<span class="sidenote">Modern Exploration in Yemen.</span>
after a short stay sailed on to Lohaia in the north of
Yemen, the exploration of which formed the principal
object of the expedition; thence, travelling through the Tehama
or lowlands, Niebuhr and his companions visited the towns of
Bet el Fakih, Zubed and Mokha, then the great port for the
coffee trade of Yemen. Continuing eastward they crossed the
mountainous region and reached the highlands of Yemen at
Uden, a small town and the centre of a district celebrated for its
coffee. Thence proceeding eastwards to higher altitudes where
coffee plantations give way to fields of wheat and barley, they
reached the town of Jibla situated among a group of mountains
exceeding 10,000 ft. above sea-level; and turning southwards
to Taiz descended again to the Tehama via Hes and Zubed to
Mokha. The mission, reduced in numbers by the death of its
archaeologist, von Haven, again visited Taiz in June 1763, where
after some delay permission was obtained to visit Sana, the
capital of the province and the residence of the ruling sovereign
or imam. The route lay by Jibla, passing the foot of the lofty
Jebel Sorak, where, in spite of illness, Forskal, the botanist
of the party, was able to make a last excursion; a few days later
he died at Yarim. The mission continued its march, passing
Dhamar, the seat of a university of the Zedi sect, then frequented
by 500 students. Thence four marches, generally over a stony
plateau dominated by bare, sterile mountains, brought them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span>
Sana, where they received a cordial welcome from the imam,
el Mahdi Abbas.</p>

<p>The aspect of the city must have been nearly the same as
at present; Niebuhr describes the <i>enceinte</i> flanked by towers,
the citadel at the foot of J. Nukum which rises 1000 ft. above the
valley, the fortress and palace of the imams, now replaced by the
Turkish military hospital, the suburb of Bir el Azab with its
scattered houses and gardens, the Jews&rsquo; quarter and the village
of Rauda, a few miles to the north in a fertile, irrigated plain
which Niebuhr compares to that of Damascus. After a stay
of ten days at Sana the mission set out again for Mokha, travelling
by what is now the main route from the capital to Hodeda,
through the rich coffee-bearing district of J. Haraz, and thence
southward to Mokha, where they embarked for India. During the
next year three other members of the party died, leaving Niebuhr
the sole survivor. Returning to Arabia a year later, he visited
Oman and the shores of the Persian Gulf, and travelling from
Basra through Syria and Palestine he reached Denmark in 1764
after four years&rsquo; absence.</p>

<p>The period was perhaps specially favourable for a scientific
mission of the sort. The outburst of fanaticism which convulsed
Arabia twenty years later had not then reached Yemen, and
Europeans, as such, were not exposed to any special danger.
The travellers were thus able to move freely and to pursue their
scientific enquiries without hindrance from either people or ruler.
The results published in 1772 gave for the first time a comprehensive
description not only of Yemen but of all Arabia; while
the parts actually visited by Niebuhr were described with a
fulness and accuracy of detail which left little or nothing for
his successors to discover.</p>

<p>C.G. Ehrenberg and W.F. Hemprich in 1825 visited the
Tehama and the islands off the coast, and in 1836 P.E. Botta
made an important journey in southern Yemen with
a view to botanical research, but the next advance
<span class="sidenote">Asir.</span>
in geographical knowledge in south Arabia was due to the
French officers, M.O. Tamisier, Chedufau and Mary, belonging
to the Egyptian army in Asir; another Frenchman, L. Arnaud,
formerly in the Egyptian service, was the first to visit the
southern Jauf and to report on the rock-cut inscriptions and
ruins of Marib, though it was not till 1869 that a competent
<span class="sidenote">Jauf and Marib.</span>
archaeologist, J. Halévy, was able to carry out any
complete exploration there. Starting from Sana,
Halévy went north-eastward to El Madid, a town
of 5000 inhabitants and the capital of the small district
of Nihm; thence crossing a plateau, where he saw the
ruins of numerous crenellated towers, he reached the village of
Mijzar at the foot of J. Yam, on the borders of Jauf, a vast
sandy plain, extending eastwards to El Jail and El Hazm, where
Halévy made his most important discoveries of Sabaean inscriptions:
here he explored Main, the ancient capital of the
Minaeans, Kamna on the banks of the W. Kharid, the ancient
Caminacum, and Kharibat el Beda, the Nesca of Pliny, where
the Sabaean army was defeated by the Romans under Aelius
Gallus in 24 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> From El Jail Halévy travelled northward,
passing the oasis of Khab, and skirting the great desert, reached
the fertile district of Nejran, where he found a colony of Jews,
with whom he spent several weeks in the oasis of Makhlaf. An
hour&rsquo;s march to the east he discovered at the village of Medinat
el Mahud the ruins of the Nagra metropolis of Ptolemy. In
June 1870 he at last reached the goal of his journey, Marib;
here he explored the ruins of Medinat an Nahas (so called from
its numerous inscriptions engraved on brass plates), and two
hours to the east he found the famous dam constructed by the
Himyarites across the W. Shibwan, on which the water-supply
of their capital depended.</p>

<p>One other explorer has since visited Marib, the Austrian
archaeologist, E. Glaser (1855-1908), who achieved more for
science in Yemen than any traveller since Niebuhr. Under
Turkish protection, he visited the territory of the Hashid and
Bakil tribes north-east of Sana, and though their hostile attitude
compelled him to return after reaching their first important
town, Khamr, he had time to reconnoitre the plateau lying
between the two great wadis Kharid and Hirran, formerly
covered with Himyaritic towns and villages; and to trace the
course of these wadis to their junction at El Ish in the Dhu
Husen country, and thence onward to the Jauf. In 1889 he
succeeded, again under Turkish escort, in reaching Marib, where
he obtained, during a stay of thirty days, a large number of new
Himyaritic inscriptions. He was unable, however, to proceed
farther east than his predecessors, and the problem of the Jauf
drainage and its possible connexion with the upper part of the
Hadramut valley still remains unsolved.</p>

<p>The earliest attempt to penetrate into the interior from the
south coast was made in 1835 when Lieuts. C. Cruttenden and
J.R. Wellsted of the &ldquo;Palinurus,&rdquo; employed on the
marine survey of the Arabian coast, visited the ruins
<span class="sidenote">Exploration in Hadramut.</span>
of Nakb (el Hajar) in the W. Mefat. The Himyaritic
inscriptions found there and at Husn Ghurab near
Mukalla, were the first records discovered of ancient Arabian
civilization in Hadramut. Neither of these officers was able to
follow up their discoveries, but in 1843 Adolph von Wrede
landed at Mukalla and, adopting the character of a pilgrim to
the shrine of the prophet Hud, made his way northward across
the high plateau into the W. Duwan, one of the main southern
tributaries of the Hadramut valley, and pushed on to the
edge of the great southern desert; on his return to the W.
Duwan his disguise was detected and he was obliged to return
to Mukalla. Though he did not actually enter the main Hadramut
valley, which lay to the east of his track, his journey established
the existence of this populous and fertile district which
had been reported to the officers of the &ldquo;Palinurus&rdquo; as lying
between the coast range and the great desert to the north. This
was at last visited in 1893 by L. Hirsch under the protection
of the sultan of Mukalla, the head of the Kaiti family, and
practically ruler of all Hadramut, with the exception of the towns
of Saiyun and Tarim, which belong to the Kathiri tribe. Starting
like von Wrede from Mukalla, Hirsch first visited the W.
Duwan and found ancient ruins and inscriptions near the village
of Hajren; thence he proceeded north-eastward to Hauta in
the main valley, where he was hospitably received by the Kaiti
sultan, and sent on to his deputy at Shibam. Here he procured
a Kathiri escort and pushed on through Saiyun to Tarim, the
former capital. After a very brief stay, however, he was compelled
by the hostility of the people to return in haste to Shibam,
from which he travelled by the W. bin Ali and W. Adim back
to Mukalla. J. Theodore Bent and his wife followed in the same
track a few months later with a well-equipped party including
a surveyor, Imam Sharif, lent by the Indian government, who
made a very valuable survey of the country passed through. Both
parties visited many sites where Himyaritic remains and inscriptions
were found, but the hostile attitude of the natives, more
particularly of the Seyyids, the religious hierarchy of Hadramut,
prevented any adequate examination, and much of archaeological
interest undoubtedly remains for future travellers to discover.</p>

<p>In Oman, where the conditions are more favourable, explorers
have penetrated only a short distance from the coast. Niebuhr
did not go inland from Muscat; the operations by a
British Indian force on the Pirate coast in 1810 gave
<span class="sidenote">Exploration in Oman.</span>
no opportunities for visiting the interior, and it was
not till 1835 that J.R. Wellsted, who had already
tried to penetrate into Hadramut from the south, landed at
Muscat with the idea of reaching it from the north-east. Sailing
thence to Sur near Ras el Had, he travelled southward through
the country of the Bani bu Ali to the borders of the desert, then
turning north-west up the Wadi Betha through a fertile, well-watered
country, running up to the southern slopes of J. Akhdar,
inhabited by a friendly people who seem to have welcomed him
everywhere, he visited Ibra, Semed and Nizwa at the southern
foot of the mountains. Owing to the disturbed state of the
country, due to the presence of raiding parties from Nejd,
Wellsted was unable to carry out his original intention of exploring
the country to the west, and after an excursion along
the Batina coast to Sohar he returned to India.</p>

<p>In 1876 Colonel S.B. Miles, who had already done much to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
advance geographical interests in south Arabia, continued
Wellsted&rsquo;s work in Oman; starting from Sohar on the Batina
coast he crossed the dividing range into the Dhahira, and reached
Birema, one of its principal oases. His investigations show that
the Dhahira contains many settlements, with an industrious
agricultural population, and that the unexplored tract extending
250 m. west to the peninsula of El Katr is a desolate gravelly
steppe, shelving gradually down to the salt marshes which border
the shores of the gulf.</p>

<p>Leaving southern Arabia, we now come to the centre and
north. The first explorer to enter the sacred Hejaz with a
definite scientific object was the Spaniard, Badia y
Leblich, who, under the name of Ali Bey and claiming
<span class="sidenote">Exploration in Hejaz.</span>
to be the last representative of the Abbasid Caliphs,
arrived at Jidda in 1807, and performed the pilgrimage
to Mecca. Besides giving to the world the first accurate
description of the holy city and the Haj ceremonies, he was the first to
fix the position of Mecca by astronomical observations, and to
describe the physical character of its surroundings. But the
true pioneer of exploration in Hejaz was J.L. Burckhardt, who
had already won a reputation as the discoverer of Petra, and
whose experience of travel in Arab lands and knowledge of Arab
life qualified him to pass as a Moslem, even in the headquarters
of Islam. Burckhardt landed in Jidda in July 1814, when
Mehemet Ali had already driven the Wahhabi invaders out of
Hejaz, and was preparing for his farther advance against their
stronghold in Nejd. He first visited Taif at the invitation of the
pasha, thence he proceeded to Mecca, where he spent three
months studying every detail of the topography of the holy
places, and going through all the ceremonies incumbent on a
Moslem pilgrim. In January 1815 he travelled to Medina by
the western or coast route, and arrived there safely but broken
in health by the hardships of the journey. His illness did not,
however, prevent his seeing and recording everything of interest
in Medina with the same care as at Mecca, though it compelled
him to cut short the further journey he had proposed to himself,
and to return by Yambu and the sea to Cairo, where he died
only two years later.</p>

<p>His striking successor, Sir Richard Burton, covered nearly
the same ground thirty-eight years afterwards. He, too, travelling
as a Moslem pilgrim, noted the whole ritual of the pilgrimage
with the same keen observation as Burckhardt, and while
amplifying somewhat the latter&rsquo;s description of Medina, confirms
the accuracy of his work there and at Mecca in almost every
detail. Burton&rsquo;s topographical descriptions are fuller, and his
march to Mecca from Medina by the eastern route led him over
ground not traversed by any other explorer in Hejaz: this route
leads at first south-east from Medina, and then south across the
lava beds of the Harra, keeping throughout its length on the high
plateau which forms the borderland between Hejaz and Nejd.
His original intention had been after visiting Mecca to find his
way across the peninsula to Oman, but the time at his disposal
(as an Indian officer on leave) was insufficient for so extended a
journey; and his further contributions to Arabian geography
were not made until twenty-five years later, when he was deputed
by the Egyptian government to examine the reported gold
deposits of Midian. Traces of ancient workings were found in
several places, but the ores did not contain gold in paying
quantities. Interesting archaeological discoveries were made,
and a valuable topographical survey was carried out, covering
the whole Midian coast from the head of the Gulf of Akaba to
the mouth of the Wadi Hamd, and including both the Tehama
range and the Hisma valley behind it; while the importance
of the W. Hamd and the extent of the area drained by its
tributaries was for the first time brought to light.</p>

<p>Burckhardt had hoped in 1815 that the advance of the
Egyptian expedition would have given him the opportunity
to see something of Nejd, but he had already left
Arabia before the overthrow of the Wahhabi power
<span class="sidenote">Exploration in Nejd.</span>
by Ibrahim Pasha had opened Nejd to travellers from
Hejaz, and though several European officers accompanied
the expedition, none of them left any record of his
experience. It is, however, to the Egyptian conquest that the
first visit of a British traveller to Nejd is due. The Indian
government, wishing to enter into relations with Ibrahim Pasha,
as <i>de facto</i> ruler of Nejd and El Hasa, with a view to putting down
piracy in the Persian Gulf, which was seriously affecting Indian
trade, sent a small mission under Captain G.F. Sadlier to
congratulate the pasha on the success of the Egyptian arms,
and no doubt with the ulterior object of obtaining a first-hand
report on the real situation. On his arrival at Hofuf, Sadlier
found that Ibrahim had already left Deraiya, but still hoping
to intercept him before quitting Nejd, he followed up the retreating
Egyptians through Yemama, and Wushm to Ras in Kasim,
where he caught up the main body of Ibrahim&rsquo;s army, though
the pasha himself had gone on to Medina. Sadlier hesitated
about going farther, but he was unable to obtain a safe conduct
to Basra, or to return by the way he had come, and was compelled
reluctantly to accompany the army to Medina. Here he
at last met Ibrahim, but though courteously received, the
interview had no results, and Sadlier soon after left for Yambu,
whence he embarked for Jidda, and after another fruitless attempt
to treat with Ibrahim, sailed for India. If the political results
of the mission were <i>nil</i>, the value to geographical science was
immense; for though no geographer himself, Sadlier&rsquo;s route
across Arabia made it possible for the first time to locate the
principal places in something like their proper relative positions;
incidentally, too, it showed the practicability of a considerable
body of regular troops crossing the deserts of Nejd even in the
months of July and August.</p>

<p>Sadlier&rsquo;s route had left Jebel Shammar to one side; his
successor, G.A. Wallin, was to make that the objective of his
journey. Commissioned by Mehemet Ali to inform him about the
situation in Nejd brought about by the rising power of Abdallah
Ibn Rashid, Wallin left Cairo in April 1845, and crossing the
pilgrim road at Ma&rsquo;an, pushed on across the Syrian desert to
the Wadi Sirhan and the Jauf oasis, where he halted during the
hot summer months. From the wells of Shakik he crossed the
waterless Nafud in four days to Jubba, and after a halt there in
the nomad camps, he moved on to Hail, already a thriving town,
and the capital of the Shammar state whose limits included all
northern Arabia from Kasim to the Syrian border. After a stay
in Hail, where he had every opportunity of observing the character
of the country and its inhabitants, and the hospitality and
patriarchal, if sometimes stern, justice of its chief, he travelled
on to Medina and Mecca, and returned thence to Cairo to report
to his patron. Early in 1848 he again returned to Arabia,
avoiding the long desert journey by landing at Muwela, thence
striking inland to Tebuk on the pilgrim road, and re-entering
Shammar territory at the oasis of Tema, he again visited Hail;
and after spending a month there travelled northwards to
Kerbela and Bagdad.</p>

<p>The effects of the Egyptian invasion had passed away, and
central Arabia had settled down again under its native rulers
when W.G. Palgrave made his adventurous journey
through Nejd, and published the remarkable narrative
<span class="sidenote">Palgrave&rsquo;s journey to Nejd.</span>
which has taken its place as the classic of Arabian
exploration. Like Burton he was once an officer in the
Indian army, but for some time before his journey he had been
connected with the Jesuit mission in Syria. By training and
temperament he was better qualified to appreciate and describe
the social life of the people than their physical surroundings,
and if the results of his great journey are disappointing to the
geographer, his account of the society of the oasis towns, and of
the remarkable men who were then ruling in Hail and Riad,
must always possess an absorbing interest as a portrait of Arab
life in its freest development.</p>

<p>Following Wallin&rsquo;s route across the desert by Ma&rsquo;an and Jauf,
Palgrave and his companion, a Syrian Christian, reached Hail
in July 1862; here they were hospitably entertained by the
amir Talal, nephew of the founder of the Ibn Rashid dynasty,
and after some stay passed on with his countenance through
Kasim to southern Nejd. Palgrave says little of the desert part
of the journey or of its Bedouin inhabitants, but much of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span>
fertility of the oases and of the civility of the townsmen; and
like other travellers in Nejd he speaks with enthusiasm of its
bright, exhilarating climate. At Riad, Fesal, who had been in
power since the Egyptian retirement, was still reigning; and
the religious tyranny of Wahhabism prevailed, in marked contrast
to the liberal régime of Talal in Jebel Shammar. Still,
Palgrave and his companions, though known as Christians,
spent nearly two months in the capital without molestation,
making short excursions in the neighbourhood, the most important
of which was to El Kharfa in Aflaj, the most southerly
district of Nejd. Leaving Riad, they passed through Yemama,
and across a strip of sandy desert to El Hasa where Palgrave
found himself in more congenial surroundings. Finally, a voyage
to the Oman coast and a brief stay there brought his adventures
in Arabia to a successful ending.</p>

<p>Charles Doughty, the next Englishman to visit northern
Arabia, though he covered little new ground, saw more of the
desert life, and has described it more minutely and
faithfully than any other explorer. Travelling down
<span class="sidenote">Doughty.</span>
from Damascus in 1875 with the Haj caravan, he stopped at El
Hajr, one of the pilgrim stations, with the intention of awaiting
the return of the caravan and in the meantime of exploring the
rock-cut tombs of Medain Salih and El Ala. Having successfully
completed his investigations and sent copies of inscriptions and
drawings of the tombs to Renan in Paris, he determined to push
on farther into the desert. Under the protection of a sheikh of
the Fukara Bedouin he wandered over the whole of the borderland
between Hejaz and Nejd. Visiting Tema, where among
other ancient remains he discovered the famous inscribed stone,
afterwards acquired by Huber for the Louvre. Next summer he
went on to Hail and thence back to Khaibar, where the negro
governor and townsmen, less tolerant than his former Bedouin
hosts, ill-treated him and even threatened his life. Returning
to Hail in the absence of the amir, he was expelled by the
governor; he succeeded, however, in finding protection at
Aneza, where he spent several months, and eventually after
many hardships and perils found his way to the coast at Jidda.</p>

<p>Three years later Mr Wilfrid and Lady Anne Blunt made their
expedition to J. Shammar. In their previous travels in Syria
they had gained the confidence and friendship of a young sheikh
whose family, though long settled at Tadmur, came originally
from Nejd, and who was anxious to renew the connexion with his
kinsmen by seeking a bride among them. In his company the
Blunts set out from Damascus, and travelled across the Syrian
desert by the Wadi Sirhan to Jauf. Here the sheikh found some
of his relations and the matrimonial alliance was soon arranged;
but though the object of the journey had been attained, the
Blunts were anxious to visit Hail and make the acquaintance of
the amir Ibn Rashid, of whose might and generosity they daily
heard from their hosts in Jauf. The long stretch of waterless
desert between Jauf and J. Shammar was crossed without
difficulty, and the party was welcomed by the amir and hospitably
entertained for a month, after which they travelled northwards
in company with the Persian pilgrim caravan returning to
Kerbela and Bagdad.</p>

<p>In 1883 the French traveller, C. Huber, accompanied by the
archaeologist, J. Euting, followed the same route from Damascus
to Hail. The narrative of the last named forms a
valuable supplement to that published by the Blunts,
<span class="sidenote">Huber.</span>
and together with Doughty&rsquo;s, furnishes as complete a picture
as could be wished for of the social and political life of J. Shammar,
and of the general nature of the country. Huber&rsquo;s journal,
published after his death from his original notes, contains a mass
of topographical and archaeological detail of the greatest scientific
value: his routes and observations form, in fact, the first
and only scientific data for the construction of the map of
northern Arabia. To archaeology also his services were of equal
importance, for, besides copying numerous inscriptions in the district
between Hail and Tema, he succeeded in gaining possession
of the since famous Tema stone, which ranks with the Moabite
stone among the most valuable of Semitic inscriptions. From
Hail Huber followed nearly in Doughty&rsquo;s track to Aneza and
thence across central Nejd to Mecca and Jidda, where he
despatched his notes and copies of inscriptions. A month later,
in July 1884, he was murdered by his guides a few marches
north of Jidda, on his way back to Hail.</p>

<p>One other traveller visited Hail during the lifetime of the
amir Mahommed&mdash;Baron E. Nolde&mdash;who arrived there in 1893,
not long after the amir had by his victory over the combined
forces of Riad and Kasim brought the whole of Nejd under his
dominion. Nolde crossed the Nafud to Haiyania by a more
direct track than that from Shakik to Jubba. The amir was away
from his capital settling the affairs of his newly acquired territory;
Nolde therefore, after a short halt at Hail, journeyed on to Ibn
Rashid&rsquo;s camp somewhere in the neighbourhood of Shakra.
Here he was on new ground, but unfortunately he gives little or
no description of his route thither, or of his journey northwards
by the Persian pilgrim road, already traversed by Huber in 1881.
His narrative thus, while containing much of general interest on
the climate and on the animal life of northern Arabia, its horses
and camels in particular, adds little to those of his predecessors
as regards topographical detail.</p>

<p>If the journeys detailed above be traced on the map they
will be found to cover the northern half of the peninsula above
the line Mecca-Hofuf, with a network of routes,
which, though sometimes separated by wide intervals,
<span class="sidenote">General results of exploration.</span>
are still close enough to ensure that no important
geographical feature can have been overlooked,
especially in a country whose general character varies so little
over wide areas. In the southern half, on the other hand, except
in Nejran and Jauf, no European traveller has penetrated 100 m.
in a direct line from the coast. The vast extent of the Dahna, or
great southern desert, covering perhaps 250,000 sq. m., accounts
for about a third of this area, but some of the most favoured
districts in Arabia&mdash;Asir and northern Yemen&mdash;remain unexplored,
and the hydrography of the Dawasir basin offers some
interesting problems, while a great field remains for the archaeologist
in the seat of the old Sabaean kingdom from Jauf to the
Hadramut valley.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Topographical Details.</i>&mdash;Beginning from the north-west, the Sinai
peninsula belongs to Egypt, though geographically part of Arabia.
It is bounded on the E. by a line drawn from Ar Rafa, a
few miles E. of El Arish on the Mediterranean, to the head
<span class="sidenote">Sinai Peninsula.</span>
of the Gulf of Akaba; and on the W. by the Suez Canal;
its length from El Arish to its most southern point is
240 m., and its breadth from Suez to Akaba is nearly 160 m. The
greater part drains to the Mediterranean, from which the land rises
gradually to the summit of the Tih plateau. The deep depression of
Wadi Feran separates the Tih from the higher mass of Sinai (<i>q.v.</i>),
in which J. Katherine attains a height of 8500 ft.; except in W.
Feran there is little cultivable land, the greater part consisting of
bare, rocky hills and sandy valleys, sparsely covered with tamarisk
and acacia bushes. The Egyptian pilgrim road crosses the peninsula
from Suez to Akaba, passing the post of An Nakhl, with a reservoir
and a little cultivation, about half way; a steep descent leads down
from the edge of the Tih plateau to Akaba.</p>

<p>The rest of the northern borderland is covered by the Syrian
desert, extending from the borders of Palestine to the edge of the
Euphrates valley. This tract, known as the Hamad, is a
gravelly plain unbroken by any considerable range of hills
<span class="sidenote">Syrian desert.</span>
or any continuous watercourse except the Wadi Hauran,
which in rainy seasons forms a succession of pools from J. Hauran
to the Euphrates. Its general slope is to the north-east from the
volcanic plateau of the Harra south of J. Hauran to the edge of the
Euphrates valley. The Wadi Sirhan, a broad depression some 500 ft.
below the average level of the Hamad, crosses it from north-east to
south-west between Hauran and Jauf; it has a nearly uniform
height above sea-level of 1850 ft., and appears to be the bed of an
inland sea rather than a true watercourse. Water is found in it a
few feet below the surface, and a little cultivation is carried on at
the small oases of Kaf and Ithri, whence salt produced in the neighbouring
salt lakes is exported. The W. Sirhan is continuous with the
depression known as the Jauf, situated on the northern edge of the
Nefud or Nafud, and the halfway station between Damascus and
Hail; and it is possible that this depression continues eastward
towards the Euphrates along a line a little north of the thirtieth
parallel, where wells and pasturages are known to exist. Jauf is a
small town consisting, at the time of the Blunts&rsquo; visit in 1879,
of not more than 500 houses. The town with its gardens, surrounded
by a mud wall, covers a space of 2 m. in length by half a mile in
width; the basin in which it lies is barely 3 m. across, and except
for the palm gardens and a few patches of corn, it is a dead flat of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
white sand, closed in by high sandstone cliffs, beyond which lies the
open desert. The oases of Sakaka and Kara are situated in a similar
basin 15 m. to the east; the former a town of 10,000 inhabitants
and somewhat larger than Jauf according to Huber.</p>

<p>A short distance south of Jauf the character of the desert changes
abruptly from a level black expanse of gravel to the red sands of the
Nafud. The northern edge of this great desert follows
very nearly the line of the thirtieth parallel, along which
<span class="sidenote">The Nafud.</span>
it extends east and west for a length of some 400 m.;
its breadth from north to south is 200 m. Though almost waterless,
it is in fact better wooded and richer in pasture than any part of
the Hamad; the sand-hills are dotted with <i>ghada</i>, a species of
tamarisk, and other bushes, and several grasses and succulent plants
&mdash;among them the <i>adar</i>, on which sheep are said to feed for a month
without requiring water&mdash;are found in abundance in good seasons.
In the spring months, when their camels are in milk, the Bedouins
care nothing for water, and wander far into the Nafud with their
flocks in search of the green pasture which springs up everywhere
after the winter rains. A few wells exist actually in the Nafud in the
district called El Hajra, near its north-eastern border, and along
its southern border, between J. Shammar and Tema, there are
numerous wells and artificial as well as natural reservoirs resorted to
by the nomad tribes.</p>

<p>Owing to the great extent of the Nafud desert, the formation of
sand-dunes is exemplified on a proportionate scale. In many places
longitudinal dunes are found exceeding a day&rsquo;s journey in length,
the valleys between which take three or four hours to cross; but
the most striking feature of the Nafud are the high crescent-shaped
sand-hills, known locally as <i>falk</i> or <i>falj</i>, described by Blunt and
Huber, who devoted some time to their investigation. The falks
enclose a deep hollow (known as <i>ka&lsquo;r</i>), the floor of which is often hard
soil bare of sand, and from which the inner slopes of the falk rise as
steeply as the sand will lie (about 50°). On the summit of the falk
there is generally a mound known as <i>tas</i> or <i>barkhus</i> composed of
white sand which stands out conspicuously against the deep red of
the surrounding deserts; the exterior slopes are comparatively
gentle. The falks are singularly uniform in shape, but vary greatly
in size; the largest were estimated by Huber and Euting at 1¼ m.
across and 330 ft. deep. They run in strings irregularly from east
to west, corresponding in this with their individual direction, the
convex face of the falk being towards the west, <i>i.e.</i> the direction of
the prevailing wind, and the cusps to leeward. In the south of the
Nafud, where Huber found the prevailing wind to be from the south,
the falks are turned in that direction. Though perhaps subject to
slight changes in the course of years, there is no doubt that these
dunes are practically permanent features; the more prominent ones
serve as landmarks and have well-known distinctive names. The
character of the vegetation which clothes their slopes shows that
even superficial changes must be slight. The general level of the
Nafud was found by Huber&rsquo;s observations to be about 3000 ft. above
sea-level; the highest point on the Jauf-Hail route is at Falk Alam,
the rocky peaks of which rise 200 or 300 ft. above the surface of the
sand. Other peaks cropping out of the Nafud are Jebel Tawil, near
the wells of Shakik, and J. Abrak Rada, a long black ridge in the
middle of the desert.</p>

<p>The high plateau which from. J. Hauran southward forms the main
watershed of the peninsula is covered in places by deep beds of lava,
which from their hardness have preserved the underlying
sandstones from degradation, and now stand up considerably
<span class="sidenote">The Harra.</span>
above the general level. These tracts are known as
<i>harra</i>; the most remarkable is the Harrat El Awerid, west of the
Haj route from Tebuk to El Ala, a mountain mass 100 m. in length
with an average height of over 5000 ft., and the highest summit of
which, J. Anaz, exceeds 7000 ft. The harra east of Khaibar is also
of considerable extent, and the same formation is found all along
the Hejaz border from Medina to the Jebel el Kura, east of Mecca.
The surface of the harra is extremely broken, forming a labyrinth of
lava crags and blocks of every size; the whole region is sterile and
almost waterless, and compared with the Nafud it produces little
vegetation; but it is resorted to by the Bedouin in the spring and
summer months when the air is always fresh and cool. In winter it
is cold and snow often lies for some time.</p>

<p>Hejaz, if we except the Taif district in the south, which is properly
a part of the Yemen plateau, forms a well-marked physical division,
lying on the western slope of the peninsula, where that
slope is at its widest, between the Harra and the Red Sea.
<span class="sidenote">Hejaz.</span>
A high range of granite hills, known as the Tehama range, the highest
point of which, J. Shar, in Midian, exceeds 6500 ft., divides it
longitudinally into a narrow littoral and a broader upland zone
2000 or 3000 ft. above the sea. Both are generally bare and unproductive,
the uplands, however, contain the fertile valleys of
Khaibar and Medina, draining to the Wadi Hamd, the principal
river system of western Arabia; and the Wadi Jadid or Es Safra,
rising in the Harra between Medina and Es Safina, which contain
several settlements, of which the principal produce is dates. The
quartz reefs which crop out in the granite ranges of the Tehama
contain traces of gold. These and the ancient copper workings were
investigated by Burton in 1877. The richer veins had evidently
been long ago worked out, and nothing of sufficient value to justify
further outlay was discovered. The coast-line is fringed with small
islets and shoals and reefs, which make navigation dangerous. The
only ports of importance are Yambu and Jidda, which serve respectively
Medina and Mecca; they depend entirely on the pilgrim
traffic to the holy cities, without which they could not exist.</p>

<p>The great central province of Nejd occupies all inner Arabia
between the Nafud and the southern desert. Its northern part
forms the basin of the Wadi Rumma, which, rising in the
Khaibar harra, runs north-eastward across the whole
<span class="sidenote">Nejd.</span>
width of Nejd, till it is lost in the sands of the eastern Nafud, north
of Aneza. The greater portion of this region is an open steppe,
sandy in places and in others dotted with low volcanic hills, but with
occasional ground water and in favourable seasons furnishing support
for a considerable pastoral population. Its elevation varies from
about 5000 ft. in the west to 2500 ft. in the east. In Jebel Shammar,
Kasim and Wushm, where the water in the wadi beds rises nearly
to the ground level, numerous fertile oases are found with thriving
villages and towns.</p>

<p>Jebel Shammar, from which the northern district of Nejd takes
its name, is a double range of mountains some 20 m. apart, rising
sharply out of the desert in bare, granite cliffs. J. Aja, the western
and higher of the two ranges, has a length of about 100 m. from
north-east to south-west, where it merges into the high plateau
extending from and continuous with the Khaibar harra. The highest
point, J. Kara, near its north-eastern extremity, is about 4600 ft.
above sea-level, or 1600 ft. above the town of Hail, which, like most
of the larger villages, lies along the wadi bed at the foot of J. Aja.
The town, which has risen with the fortunes of the Ibn Rashid
family to be the capital of Upper Nejd, is at the mouth of the valley
between the twin ranges, about 2 m. from the foot of J. Aja,
and contained at the time of Nolde&rsquo;s visit in 1893 about 12,000
inhabitants.</p>

<p>The principal tributaries of the W. Rumma converge in lower
Kasim, and at Aneza Doughty says its bed is 3 m. wide from bank
to bank. Forty years before his visit a flood is said to have occurred,
which passed down the river till it was blocked by sand-drifts at
Thuwerat, 50 m. lower down, and for two years a lake stood nearly
100 m. long, crowded by waterfowl not known before in that desert
country. Below this its course has not been followed by any European
traveller, but it may be inferred from the line of watering-places
on the road to Kuwet, that it runs out to the Persian Gulf in that
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>East of Kasim the land rises gradually to the high plateau culminating
in the ranges of Jebel Tuwek and J. Arid. The general direction
of these hills is from north-west to south-east. On the west they rise
somewhat steeply, exposing high cliffs of white limestone, which
perhaps gave Palgrave the impression that the range is of greater
absolute height than is actually the case. J. Tuwek in any case
forms an important geographical feature in eastern Nejd, interrupting
by a transverse barrier 200 m. in length the general north-easterly
slope of the peninusla, and separating the basin of the W. Rumma
from that of the other great river system of central Arabia, the Wadi
Dawasir. The districts of Suder and Wushm lie on its northern side,
Arid in the centre, and Aflaj, Harik and Yemama on its south, in the
basin of the W. Dawasir; the whole of this hilly region of eastern
Nejd is, perhaps, rather a rolling down country than truly mountainous,
in which high pastures alternate with deep fertile valleys,
supporting numerous villages with a large agricultural population.
The W. Hanifa is its principal watercourse; its course is marked by
an almost continuous series of palm groves and settlements, among
which Deraiya the former, and Riad the present, capital of the Ibn
Saud kingdom are the most extensive. Its lower course is uncertain,
but it probably continues in a south-east direction to the districts
of El Harik and Yemama when, joined by the drainage from Aflaj
and the W. Dawasir, it runs eastward till it disappears in the belt of
sandy desert 100 m. in width that forms the eastern boundary of
Nejd, to reappear in the copious springs that fertilize El Hasa and
the Bahrein littoral.</p>

<p>As regards the unexplored southern region, Palgrave&rsquo;s informants
in Aflaj, the most southerly district visited by him, stated that a
day&rsquo;s march south of that place the Yemen road enters
the W. Dawasir, up which it runs for ten days, perhaps
<span class="sidenote">Unexplored region of S. Nejd.</span>
200 m., to El Kura, a thinly peopled district on the borders
of Asir; this accords with the information of the French
officers of the Egyptian army in that district, and with that
of Halévy, who makes all the drainage from Nejran northward run
to the same great wadi. Whether there be any second line of drainage
in southern Nejd skirting the edge of the great desert and following
the depression of the W. Yabrin must remain a matter of conjecture.
Colonel Miles concluded, from his enquiries, that the low salt swamp,
extending inland for some distance from Khor ed Duwan, in the bay
east of El Katr, was the outlet of an extensive drainage system
which may well be continuous with the W. Yabrin and extend far
into the interior, if not to Nejran itself.</p>

<p>East of Nejd a strip of sandy desert 50 m. in width extends almost
continuously from the great Nafud to the Dahna. East of this again
a succession of stony ridges running parallel to the coast
has to be crossed before El Hasa is reached. This
<span class="sidenote">El Hasa.</span>
province, which skirts the Persian Gulf from the mouth of the
Euphrates to the frontiers of Oman, is low and hot; its shores are
flat, and with the exception of Kuwet at the north-west corner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span>
the gulf, it possesses no deep water port. North of Katif it is desert
and only inhabited by nomads; at Katif, however, and throughout
the district to the south bordering on the Gulf of Bahrein there are
ample supplies of underground water, welling up in abundant springs
often at a high temperature, and bringing fertility to an extensive
district of which El Hofuf, a town of 15,000 to 20,000 inhabitants,
is the most important centre.</p>

<p>South-western Arabia, from the twenty-first parallel down to the
Gulf of Aden, including the Taif district of Hejaz, Asir and Yemen,
forms one province geographically. Throughout its length
it consists of three zones, a narrow coastal strip, rarely
<span class="sidenote">South-western Arabia.</span>
exceeding 20 m. in width, a central mountainous tract,
embracing the great chain which runs parallel to the coast
from near Taif to within 50 m. of Aden, and an inner plateau falling
gradually to the north-east till it merges in the Nejd steppes or the
sands of the great desert.</p>

<p>The lowland strip or Tehama consists partly of a gravelly plain,
the <i>Khabt</i>, covered sparsely with acacia and other desert shrubs and
trees, and furnishing pasturage for large flocks of goats and camels;
and partly of sterile wastes of sand like the <i>Ramla</i>, which extends
on either side of Aden almost from the seashore to the foot of the
hills. The Tehama is, however, by no means all desert, the mountain
torrents where they debouch into the plain have formed considerable
tracts of alluvial soil of the highest degree of fertility producing in
that warm equable climate two and even three crops in the year.
The flood-water is controlled by a system of dams and channels
constructed so as to utilize every drop, and the extent of cultivation
is limited more by the supply of water available than by the amount
of suitable soil. These districts support a large settled population
and several considerable towns, of which Bet el Fakih and Zubed in
the western and Lahej in the southern Tehama, with 4000 to 6000
inhabitants, are the most important. There are signs that this
coastal strip was until a geologically recent period below sea-level;
and that the coast-line is still receding is evidenced by the history
of the town of Muza, once a flourishing port, now 20 m. inland;
while Bet el Fakih and Zubed, once important centres of the coffee
trade, have lost their position through the silting up of the ports
which formerly served them.</p>

<p>The jebel or mountain-land is, however, the typical Yemen, the
<i>Arabia Felix</i> of the ancients. Deep valleys winding through the
barren foothills lead gradually up to the higher mountains, and as the
track ascends the scenery and vegetation change their character;
the trees which line the banks of the wadi are overgrown with
creepers, and the running stream is dammed at frequent intervals,
and led off in artificial channels to irrigate the fields on either side;
the steeper parts of the road are paved with large stones, substantially
built villages, with their masonry towers or <i>dars</i>, crowning every
height, replace the collection of mud walls and brushwood huts of
the low country; while tier above tier, terraced fields cover the hill
slopes and attest the industry of the inhabitants and the fertility
of their mountains. On the main route from Hodeda to Sana the
first coffee plantations are reached at Usil, at an altitude of 4300 ft.,
and throughout the western slopes of the range up to an altitude of
7000 ft. it is the most important crop. Jebel Haraz, of which
Manakha, a small town of 3000 inhabitants is the chief place, is
described by Glaser as one vast coffee garden. Here the traveller
ascending from the coast sees the first example of the jebel or highland
towns, with their high three-storeyed houses, built of quarried
stone, their narrow façades pierced with small windows with whitewashed
borders and ornamented with varied arabesque patterns;
each dar has the appearance of a small castle complete in itself, and
the general effect is rather that of a cluster of separate forts than of a
town occupied by a united community.</p>

<p>The scenery in this mountain region is of the most varied description;
bare precipitous hill-sides seamed with dry, rocky watercourses
give place with almost startling rapidity to fertile slopes,
terraced literally for thousands of feet. General Haig in describing
them says: &ldquo;One can hardly realize the enormous labour, toil and
perseverance that these represent; the terrace walls are usually
5 to 8 ft. in height, but towards the top of the mountains they are
sometimes as much as 15 or 18 ft.; they are built entirely of rough
stone without mortar, and I reckon that on an average each wall
retains not more than twice its own height in breadth, and I do not
think I saw a single break in them unrepaired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The highest summits as determined by actual survey are between
10,000 and 11,000 ft. above sea-level. J. Sabur, a conspicuous mass
in the extreme south, is 9900 ft., with a fall to the Taiz valley of
5000 ft.; farther north several points in the mountains above Ibb
and Yarim attain a height of 10,500 ft., and J. Hadur, near the
Sana-Hodeda road, exceeds 10,000 ft. From the crest of the range
there is a short drop of 2000 or 3000 ft. to the broad open valleys
which form the principal feature of the inner plateau. The town of
Yarim lies near its southern extremity at an altitude of about
8000 ft.; within a short distance are the sources of the W. Yakla,
W. Bana and W. Zubed, running respectively east and south and
west. The first named is a dry watercourse ultimately joining the
basin of the W. Hadramut; the two others run for a long distance
through fertile valleys and, like many of the wadis on the seaward
side of the range, have perennial streams down to within a few miles
of the sea. Sana, the capital of Yemen, lies in a broad valley 7300 ft.
above sea-level, sloping northwards to the W. Kharid which, with
the Ghail Hirran, the sources of which are on the eastern slopes of
J. Hadur, run north-eastward to the Jauf depression. The Arhab
district, through which these two great wadis run, was formerly the
centre of the Himyar kingdom; cultivation is now only to be found
in the lower parts on the borders of the watercourses, all above
being naked rock from which every particle of soil has been denuded.
In the higher parts there are fine plains where Glaser found numerous
Himyaritic remains, and which he considers were undoubtedly
cultivated formerly, but they have long fallen out of cultivation
owing to denudation and desiccation&mdash;the impoverishment of the
country from these causes is increasing. Eastward the plateau
becomes still more sterile, and its elevation probably falls more
rapidly till it reaches the level of the Jauf and Nejran valleys on the
borders of the desert. The water-parting between central and
southern Arabia seems to be somewhere to the south of Nejran,
which, according to Halévy, drains northward to the W. Dawasir,
while the Jauf is either an isolated depression, or perhaps forms part
of the Hadramut basin.</p>

<p>Farther north, in Asir, the plateau is more mountainous and
contains many fertile valleys. Of these may be mentioned Khamis
Mishet and the Wadi Shahran rising among the high
summits of the maritime chain, and the principal affluents
<span class="sidenote">Asir.</span>
of the Wadi Besha; the latter is a broad well-watered valley, with
numerous scattered hamlets, four days&rsquo; journey (perhaps 80 m.)
from the crest of the range. Still farther north is the Wadi Taraba
and its branches running down from the highland district of Zahran.
The lower valleys produce dates in abundance, and at higher elevations
wheat, barley, millets and excellent fruit are grown, while
juniper forests are said to cover the mountain slopes. In Yemen this
tree was probably more common formerly; the place-name Arar,
signifying juniper, is still often found where the tree no longer exists.</p>

<p>The western coast of Yemen, like that of Hejaz, is studded with
shoals and islands, of which Perim in the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb,
Kamaran, the Turkish quarantine post, 40 m. north of
Hodeda, and the Farsan group, off the Abu Arish coast,
<span class="sidenote">Coast of Yemen.</span>
are the principal. Hodeda is the only port of any importance
since the days of steamships began; the other ports, Mokha,
Lohaia and Kanfuda merely share in the coasting trade. The south
coast is free from the shoals that imperil the navigation of the Red
Sea, and in Aden it possesses the only safe natural harbour on the
route between Suez and India. Several isolated volcanic hills crop
out on the shore line between Aden and the straits; the most remarkable
are J. Kharaz, 2500 ft., and J. Shamshan, 1700 ft., at the base
of which Aden itself is built. In both of these the crater form is
very clearly marked. A low maritime plain, similar to the Tehama
of the western coast, extends for some 200 m. east of the Straits of
Bab-el-Mandeb, backed by mountains rising to 7000 ft. or more;
farther east the elevation of the highland decreases steadily, and in
<span class="sidenote">Hadramut.</span>
the Hadramut, north of Mukalla, does not much exceed
4000 ft. The mountain chain, too, is less distinctly
marked, and becomes little more than the seaward escarpment of
the plateau which intervenes between the coast and the Hadramut
valley. This valley runs nearly east and west for a distance of
500 m. from the eastern slopes of the Yemen highlands to its mouth
on the Mahra coast near Sihut. The greater part of it is desert, but
a short stretch lying between the 48th and 50th meridians is well
watered and exceptionally fertile. This begins a little to the east of
Shabwa, the ancient capital, now half buried in the advancing sand,
and for a distance of over 70 m. a succession of villages and towns
surrounded by fields and date groves extends along the main valley
and into the tributaries which join it from the south. Shibam,
Saiyun and Tarim are towns of 6000 or more inhabitants, and Hajren
and Haura in the W. Duwan are among the larger villages. Himyaritic
remains have been found here and in the W. Mefat which
enters the Gulf of Aden near Balhaf. A few small fishing villages
or ports are scattered along the coast, but except Mukalla and Shihr
none is of any importance.</p>

<p>The Gara coast was visited by the Bents, who went inland from
Dhafar, one of the centres of the old frankincense trade, to the crest
of the plateau. The narrow coastal strip seems to be moderately
fertile, and the hills which in places come down to the seashore are
covered with trees, among which the frankincense and other gum-bearing
trees are found. On the plateau, which has an altitude of
4000 ft., there is good pasturage; inland the country slopes gently
to a broad valley beyond which the view was bounded by the level
horizon of the desert.</p>

<p>Oman (<i>q.v.</i>) includes all the south-eastern corner of the peninsula.
Its chief feature is the lofty range of J. Akhdar, 10,000 ft. above
sea-level. Like the great range of western Arabia, it runs
parallel to the coast; it differs, however, from the western
<span class="sidenote">Oman.</span>
range in that its fall on the landward side is as abrupt and nearly
as great as on its seaward side. Its northern extremity, Ras
Musandan, rises precipitously from the straits of Hormuz; farther
south the range curves inland somewhat, leaving a narrow but fertile
strip, known as the Batina coast, between it and the sea, and containing
several populous towns and villages of which Sohar, Barka
and Sib are the chief. Muscat, the capital of the province and the
principal port on the coast, is surrounded on three sides by bare,
rocky hills, and has the reputation of being the hottest place in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
Arabia. Zwemer says the fertility of the highland region of J.
Akhdar is wonderful and is in striking contrast to the barrenness of
so much of the coast; water issues in perennial springs from many
rocky clefts, and is carefully husbanded by the ingenuity of the
people; underground channels, known here as <i>faluj</i>, precisely similar
to the <i>kanat</i> or <i>karez</i> of Persia and Afghanistan, are also largely used.
The principal villages on the eastern slopes are Rustak, Nakhl and
Semail in the well-watered valley of the same name; on the western
slopes are Tanuf and Nizwa, lying immediately below the highest
summit of the range; Semed, Ibra and Bidiya in the W. Betha
are all well-built villages with palm-groves and irrigated fields. In
the north-west the Dhahira district sloping towards the Jewasimi
coast is more steppe-like in character; but there two oases of great
fertility are found, of which Birema, visited by both Miles and
Zwemer, supports a population of 15,000. West of Abu Dhabi a low
flat steppe with no settled inhabitants extends up to the Katr
peninsula, merging on the north into the saline marshes which border
the Persian Gulf, and on the south into the desert.</p>

<p>The great desert known as the Dahna or the Rub&rsquo;a el Khali (&ldquo;the
empty quarter&rdquo;) is believed to cover all the interior of southern
Arabia from the borders of Yemen in the west to those
of Oman in the east. Halévy in Nejran, Von Wrede in
<span class="sidenote">The southern desert.</span>
Hadramut, and Wellsted in Oman reached its edge,
though none of them actually entered it, and the guides
accompanying them all concurred in describing it as uninhabitable
and uncrossed by any track. Its northern fringe is no doubt frequented
by the Bedouin tribes of southern Nejd after the rains,
when its sands, like those of the northern desert, produce herbage;
but towards the east, according to Burckhardt&rsquo;s information, it is
quite without vegetation even in the winter and spring. The
farthest habitable spot to the south of Nejd is the Wadi Yabrin,
which L. Pelly heard of from the Ahl Murra Bedouins as once a
fertile district, and which still produces dates, though, owing to
malaria, it is now deserted; thence southward to the Hadramut
valley no communication is known to exist.</p>

<p>[<i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The geological structure of Arabia is very similar to
that of Egypt. The oldest rocks consist of granite and schist,
penetrated by intrusive dykes, and upon this foundation rest the
flat-lying sedimentary deposits, beginning with a sandstone like the
Nubian sandstone of Egypt. In the northern part of Arabia the
crystalline rocks form a broad area extending from the peninsula
of Sinai eastwards to Hail and southwards at least as far as Mecca.
Towards the north the crystalline floor is overlaid by the great
sandstone series which covers nearly the whole of the country north
of Hail. Upon the sandstone rest a few scattered outliers of limestone,
probably of Cretaceous age, the largest of which occur near
Jauf and east of Bureda. Over both sandstone and granite great
sheets of lava have been poured, and these, protecting the softer
beds beneath from further denudation, now stand up as the high
plateaus and hills called <i>harra</i>. Volcanic cones still exist in large
numbers, and the sheets of lava appear as fresh as any recent flows
of Etna or Vesuvius. Arabian manuscripts describe an eruption on
the harra near Medina in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1256. In the south of Arabia the
crystalline floor appears at intervals along the southern coast and
on the shores of the Gulf of Oman. At Marbat the granite is overlaid
by sandstone, presumably the Nubian sandstone: this is followed
by marls containing Cenomanian fossils; and these are overlaid
by Upper Cretaceous limestones, upon which rest isolated patches
of <i>Alveolina</i> limestone. Generally, however, the Cretaceous beds
do not appear, and the greater part of southern Arabia seems to be
formed of <i>Alveolina</i> and nummulite limestones of Tertiary age.
An extinct volcano occurs at Aden, and volcanic rocks are found at
other places near the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. Throughout the
whole of Arabia, so far as is known, the sedimentary beds show no
signs of any but the most gentle folding. Faulting, however, is by
no means absent, and some of the faults are of considerable magnitude.
The Gulf of Akaba is a strip of country which has been let
down between two parallel faults, and several similar faulted troughs
occur in the Sinai peninsula. The Red Sea itself is a great trough
bounded by faults along each side.]</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;Owing to its low latitude and generally arid surface,
Arabia is on the whole one of the hottest regions of the earth; this
is especially the case along the coasts of the Persian Gulf and the
southern half of the Red Sea, where the moist heat throughout the
year is almost intolerable to Europeans. In the interior of northern
and central Arabia, however, where the average level of the country
exceeds 3000 ft., the fiery heat of the summer days is followed by
cool nights, and the winter climate is fresh and invigorating; while
in the highlands of Asir and Yemen in the south-west, and of Oman
in the east, the summer heat is never excessive, and the winters are,
comparatively speaking, cold.</p>

<p>In the northern desert the temperature is subject to extreme
variations. Nolde states that on the 1st of February 1893 in the
desert north of Hail the thermometer fell from 78° a little before
sunset to 18° a quarter of an hour after. The midday temperatures
recorded by Huber at Hail during January and the first half of
February average about 65° F., and water froze on several nights;
at Medina the winters are cold and night frosts of frequent occurrence,
and these conditions prevail over all the western part of the
Nejd plateau. In the east where the elevation is lower the climate is
warmer. In the elevated highland district which extends from
Taif to within 50 m. of Aden, the summer heat is tempered by the
monsoon winds, and the seasonal variation of temperature is less
marked. From observations made at Sana by Manzoni, Deflers and
Glaser, the mean temperature for the year of that city at an altitude
of 7300 ft. and in 15° 22&prime; N. appears to be 60° F.; for July the
mean maximum was 77°, mean minimum 54°; for January the
figures were 62°and 40° respectively, the lowest recorded temperature
in 1878 was 26.6° on the 26th of January. At Aden at the sea-level
the mean temperature for the year is 83°; the highest observed
temperature in 1904 was 97.3°, the lowest 67.4°.</p>

<p>The rainfall throughout northern and central Arabia is chiefly in
the winter months between October and April, and is scanty and
irregular. Doughty states that in 1876 rain to wet the ground had
not fallen for three years at Medain Salih; in that year showers fell
on the 29th of December and on two days in January and again in
March. After a very hot summer the bright weather changed to
clouded skies on the 2nd of October, rain fell tempestuously the
same evening, and there were showery days and nights till the 14th.
The autumn rains fell that year abundantly in the Nafud towards
Jauf, but very little in the basin of the W. Hamd (on the western
slope). Doughty adds that the Nejd highlands between Kasim and
Mecca are watered yearly by seasonable rains, which at Taif are
expected about the end of August and last commonly from four to
six weeks. This appears to be about the northern limit reached by
the south-west monsoon, which from June to September brings a
fairly abundant rainfall to the Yemen highlands, though the Tehama
remains almost entirely rainless. The rainfall is heaviest along the
western fringe of the plateau, and penetrates inland in decreasing
quantity over a zone which perhaps extends to 100 m. in width. In
good seasons it is sufficient for the cultivation of the summer crop
of millet, and for the supply of the perennial streams and springs,
on which the irrigation of the winter crops of wheat and barley
depend. The amount measured at Dhala at the extreme south of
the plateau at an elevation of 4800 ft. was in 1902 as follows:&mdash;June,
4.0 in.; July, 5.5; August, 5.8; September, 1.9. Only
slight showers were recorded in the other months of the year. At
higher elevations the rainfall is no doubt heavier; Manzoni mentions
that at Sana there was constant rain throughout August and September
1878, and that the thermometer during August did not reach
65°. In the Tehama occasional showers fall during the winter
months; at Aden the average rainfall for the year is 2.97 in., but
during 1904 only 0.5 in. was recorded. Snow falls on the Harra and
on the Tehama range in northern Arabia, and Nolde records a fall of
snow which lay on the Nafud on the 1st of February 1893. It also
falls on J. Akhdar in Oman, but is very rarely known on the Yemen
mountains, probably because the precipitation during the winter
months is so slight.</p>

<p>The prevailing winds in northern Arabia as far as is known are
from the west; along the southern coast they are from the east;
at Sana there is generally a light breeze from the north-north-west
from 9 to 11 <span class="scs">A.M.</span>, from noon till 4 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> a steady and often strong
wind blows from the south-south-east, which dies away later. The
climate is extremely dry, but this is compensated for by the heavy
mists which sweep up from the plains during the rainless months
and exercise a most beneficial effect in the coffee-growing districts.
This phenomenon is known as the sukhemani or amama. In the
morning the Tehama, as seen from the mountain tops, appears
buried in a sea of white cloud; towards noon the clouds drift up
the mountain slopes and cover the summits with wreaths of light
mist charged with moisture which condenses on the trees and
vegetation; in the afternoon they disappear, and the evenings are
generally clear and still.</p>

<p><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;The wild animals of Arabia are all of the desert-loving
type: antelopes and gazelles are found in small numbers throughout
the peninsula; the latter are similar to the <i>chikara</i> or ravine deer of
India. The larger antelopes, so common on the African side of the
Gulf of Aden, are not found, except one variety, the <i>Oryx beatrix</i>
(called by the Arabs, wild cow), which is an inhabitant of the Nafud
between Tema and Hail; it is about the size of a donkey, white,
and with long straight horns. Hares are numerous both in the desert
and in cultivated tracts. In the Yemen mountains the <i>wal</i>, a wild
goat with massive horns, similar to the Kashmir ibex, is found;
monkeys also abound. Among smaller animals the jerboa and other
descriptions of rat, and the <i>wabar</i> or cony are common; lizards
and snakes are numerous, most of the latter being venomous.
Hyenas, wolves and panthers are found in most parts of the country,
and in the mountains the leopard and wild cat. Of birds the ostrich
is found in the Nafud and in the W. Dawasir. Among game birds
the bustard, guinea fowl, sand grouse (<i>kata</i>), blue rock, green pigeon,
partridge, including a large chikor (<i>akb</i>) and a small species similar
to the Punjab sisi; quail and several kinds of duck and snipe are
met with. In the cultivated parts of Yemen and Tehama small
birds are very numerous, so also are birds of prey, vultures, kites and
hawks.</p>

<p>Insects of all sorts abound; scorpions, centipedes, spiders, and an
ugly but harmless millipede known in Yemen as <i>hablub</i> are very
common in summer. Ants and beetles too are very numerous,
and anthills are prominent features in many places. Locusts appear
in great swarms and do much damage; fires are lighted at night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>
to attract them, and large quantities are caught and eaten by the
poorer people. Bees are kept, and in Yemen and Hadramut the
honey is exceptionally good.</p>

<p>Of domesticated animals the camel is far the most useful to the
Arab. Owing to its endurance of thirst the long desert journeys
which separate the populous centres are made practicable,
and in the spring months, when green forage is plentiful
<span class="sidenote">Camel.</span>
in the desert, the Bedouins pitch their camps for long periods far from
any water, and not only men but horses subsist on camel&rsquo;s milk.
The Arabian camel belongs to the one-humped species, though there
are many varieties differing in appearance as much as the thoroughbred
race-horse from the English cart-horse. The ordinary load for
a pack camel is about 400 &#8468;, and in hot weather good camels will
march 20 to 25 m. daily and only require water every third or fourth
day: in cool weather, with ample green fodder they can go twenty-five
days or more without drinking. A good <i>dalul</i> or riding camel
will carry his rider 100 m. a day for a week on end. Nolde gives an
instance from his own experience of a camel rider covering 62 m. in
seven hours. The pure-bred riding camel is only found in perfection
in inner Arabia; for some unexplained reason when taken out
of their own country or north of the 30th degree they rapidly
degenerate.</p>

<p>The horse does not occupy the important position in the Bedouin
economy that is popularly supposed. In Nejd the number of horses
is, comparatively speaking, very small; the want of
water in the Nafud where alone forage is obtainable,
<span class="sidenote">Horse.</span>
and the absence of forage in the neighbourhood of the towns makes
horse-breeding on a large scale impracticable there. Horses are in
fact only kept by the principal sheiks, and by far the larger proportion
of those now in Nejd are the property of the amir and his family.
These are kept most of the year in the Nafud, five or ten days&rsquo;
march from Hail, where they find their own food on the desert
herbage. When a raid is in contemplation, they are brought in and
given a little barley for a few weeks. Reared in this way they are
capable of marvellous endurance, marching during a raid twenty
hours a day for eight or ten days together. As a rule, they are only
mounted at the moment of attack, or in pursuit. Water and forage
have to be carried for them on camels.</p>

<p>The great majority of the horses that come into the market as
Arabs, are bred in the northern desert and in Mesopotamia, by the
various sections of the Aneza and Shammar tribes, who emigrated
from Nejd generations ago, taking with them the original Nejd
stock. In size and appearance, and in everything but endurance,
these northern horses are admittedly superior to the true Nejdi. A
few of the latter are collected by dealers in the nomad camps and
exported chiefly from Kuwet. The amir Mahommed Ibn Rashid
used to send down about one hundred young horses yearly.</p>

<p>Asses of excellent quality are bred all over the country; they
are much used as mounts by the richer townsmen. Except in the
settled districts horned cattle are not numerous; they are similar
to the Indian humped cattle, but are greatly superior in milking
qualities. The great wealth of the Arabs is in their flocks of sheep
and goats; they are led out to pasture soon after sunrise, and in the
hotter months drink every second day. In the spring when the
succulent <i>ashub</i> and <i>adar</i> grow plentifully in the desert, they go for
weeks without drinking. They are milked once a day about sunset
by the women (the men milk the camels), and a large proportion of
the milk is made into <i>samn</i>, clarified butter, or <i>marisi</i>, dried curd.
The wool is not of much value, and is spun by the women and woven
into rugs, and made up into saddlebags or into the black Bedouin
tents.</p>

<p><i>Flora.</i>&mdash;The flora of Arabia has been investigated by P. Forskal,
the botanist of Niebuhr&rsquo;s mission, P.E. Botta, G. Schweinfurth and
A. Deflers, to whose publications the technical reader is referred.
Its general type approaches more closely to the African than to
that of southern Asia. In the higher regions the principal trees are
various species of fig, tamarind, carob and numerous kinds of
cactiform <i>Euphorbia</i>, of which one, the <i>Euphorbia arborea</i>, grows to
a height of 20 ft. Of Coniferae the juniper is found on the higher
slopes of J. Sabur near Taiz, where Botta describes it as forming an
extensive forest and growing to a large size; it is also found in the
range overlooking the W. Madin, 50 m. W. of Aden. Considerable
forests are said to exist in Asir, and Burton found a few fine specimens
which he regarded as the remains of an old forest, on the
Tehama range in Midian. On the rocky hill-sides in Yemen the
<i>Adenium Obesum</i> is worthy of notice, with its enormous bulb-like
stems and brilliant red flowers. Some fine aloes or agaves are also
found. In the cultivated upland valleys all over Arabia the <i>Zisyphus
jujuba</i>, called by some travellers lotus, grows to a large tree; its
thorny branches are clipped yearly and used to fence the cornfields
among which it grows. In the broad sandy wadi beds the tamarisk
(<i>athl</i>) is everywhere found; its wood is used for making domestic
implements of all sorts. Among fruit trees the vine, apricot, peach,
apple, quince, fig and banana are cultivated in the highlands, and in
the lower country the date palm flourishes, particularly throughout
the central zone of Arabia, in Hejaz, Nejd and El Hasa, where it is
the prime article of food. A hundred kinds of date are said to grow
at Medina, of which the <i>birni</i> is considered the most wholesome;
the <i>halwa</i> and the <i>jalebi</i> are the most delicately flavoured and sell at
very high rates; the <i>khulas</i> of El Hasa is also much esteemed.</p>

<p>Of cereals the common millets, <i>dhura</i> and <i>dukhn</i>, are grown in all
parts of the country as the summer crop, and in the hot irrigated
Tehama districts three crops are reaped in the year; in the highlands
maize, wheat and barley are grown to a limited extent as the winter
crop, ripening at the end of March or in April. Among vegetables
the common kinds grown include radishes, pumpkins, cucumbers,
melons, potatoes, onions and leeks. Roses are grown in some places
for the manufacture of <i>atr</i>, or attar of roses; mignonette, jasmine,
thyme, lavender and other aromatic plants are favourites in Yemen,
when the Arabs often stick a bunch in their head-dress.</p>

<p>Of the products special to Arabia coffee comes first; it is nowhere
found wild, and is believed to have been introduced from Abyssinia
in the 6th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> It thrives on the seaward slopes
of the western range in the zone of the tropical rains, at
<span class="sidenote">Coffee.</span>
altitudes between 4000 and 7000 ft. The principal centres of production
are the upper valleys of the W. Surdad, between Kaukaban
and Manakha, and particularly on J. Haraz; in the Wadi Zubed
west of Uden; in Hajaria on the slopes of J. Sabur, and in the Yafa
district north-east of Aden. It is planted in terraces on the mountain
slopes; shady trees, such as tamarind and fig, are planted in the
border as a protection from the sun, and the terraces are irrigated
by channels led from a neighbouring rivulet or spring. The plants
are raised from seedlings, and when six or seven weeks old they are
transplanted in rows 4 to 6 ft. apart; they require watering twice
a month, and bear in two to four years. The berries are dried in the
sun and sent down to Hodeda or Aden, where they are subjected
to a process for separating the husk from the bean; the result is
about 50% of cleaned berries, <i>bun safi</i>, which is exported, and a
residue of husk or <i>kishr</i>, from which the Yemenis make their favourite
beverage.</p>

<p>Another plant universally used as a stimulant in Southern Arabia
is <i>khat</i> (<i>Catha edulis</i>). The best is grown on J. Sabur and the
mountainous country round Taiz. It is a small bush propagated from
cuttings which are left to grow for three years; the leaves are then
stripped, except a few buds which develop next year into young
shoots, these being cut and sold in bunches under the name of <i>khat
mubarak</i>; next year on the branches cut back new shoots grow;
these are sold as <i>khat malhani</i>, or second-year kat, which commands
the highest price. The bush is then left for three years, when the
process is repeated. The leaves and young shoots are chewed;
they have stimulating properties, comparable with those of the coca
of Peru.</p>

<p>The aromatic gums for which Arabia was famed in ancient times
are still produced, though the trade is a very small one. The tree
from which myrrh is extracted grows in many places, but the
industry is chiefly carried on at Suda, 60 m. north-north-east of Sana.
Longitudinal slits are made in the bark, and the gum is caught in
cups fixed beneath. The balsam of Mecca is produced in the same
way, chiefly in the mountains near the W. Safra between Yambu
and Medina.</p>

<p>The stony plains which cover so large a part of the country are
often covered with acacia jungle, and in the dry water-courses a kind
of wild palm, the <i>dom</i>, abounds, from the leaves of which baskets
and mats are woven. Brushwood and rough pasturage of some sort
is found almost everywhere, except in the neighbourhood of the
larger settlements, where forage and firewood have to be brought
in from long distances. The Nafud sands, too, are tufted in many
places with bushes or small trees, and after the winter rains they
produce excellent pasture.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The people, according to their own traditions,
are derived from two stocks, the pure Arabs, descended from
Kahtan or Joktan, fourth in descent from Shem; and the
Mustarab or naturalized Arabs, from Ishmael. The former are
represented at the present day by the inhabitants of Yemen,
Hadramut and Oman, in general a settled agricultural population;
the latter by those of Hejaz, Nejd, El Hasa, the Syrian
desert and Mesopotamia, consisting of the Bedouin or pastoral
tribes (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arabs</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bedouins</a></span>). This distinction between the
characteristics of the two races is only true in a general sense,
for a considerable population of true Bedouin origin has settled
down to agricultural life in the oases of Hejaz and Nejd, while in
southern Arabia the tribes dwelling on the fringe of the great
desert have to a certain extent adopted the nomad life.</p>

<p>Both among the nomad and settled Arabs the organization
is essentially tribal. The affairs of the tribe are administered by
the sheiks, or heads of clans and families; the position of sheik
in itself gives no real governing power, his word and counsel
carry weight, but his influence depends on his own personal
qualities. All matters affecting the community are discussed in
the <i>majlis</i> or assembly, to which any tribesman has access;
here, too, are brought the tribesmen&rsquo;s causes; both sides plead
and judgment is given impartially, the loser is fined so many
head of small cattle or camels, which he must pay or go into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
exile. Murder can be expiated by the payment of <i>diya</i> or
blood-money, if the kinsmen of the murdered man consent; they
may, however, claim the life of the murderer, and long and
troublesome blood feuds often ensue, involving the relatives of
both sides for generations.</p>

<p>Apart from the tribesmen there is in Hejaz and south Arabia
a privileged, religious class, the Sharifs or Seyyids, who claim
descent from Mahomet through his daughter Fatima. Until the
Egyptian invasion in 1814 the Sharifs of Mecca were the recognized
rulers of Hejaz, and though the Turks have attempted to
suppress their importance, the Sharif still executes justice according
to the Mahommedan law in the holy cities, though, nominally,
as a Turkish official. In Yemen and Hadramut many villages
are occupied exclusively by this religious hierarchy, who are
known as Ashraf, Sada or Kudha (<i>i.e.</i> Sharifs, Seyyids or Kadhis);
the religious affairs of the tribes are left in their hands; they do
not, however, interfere in tribal matters generally, or join in
fighting.</p>

<p>Below these two classes, which may be looked on as the priestly
and the military castes, there is, especially in the settled districts,
a large population of artisans and labourers, besides negro slaves
and their descendants, slave or free. The population of Khaibar
consists almost entirely of the latter, and in Hail Huber estimates
the pure Arab inhabitants at only one-third of the whole. In the
desert, too, there is a widely scattered tribe, the Salubi, which
from its name (<i>Salib</i>, cross) is conjectured to be of early Christian
origin; they are great hunters, killing ostriches and gazelles;
the Arabs despise them as an inferior race, but do not harm
them; they pay a small tax to the tribe under whose protection
they live, and render service as labourers, for which they receive
in the spring milk and cheese; at the date harvest they get
wages in kind; with this, and the produce of the chase,
they manage to exist in the desert without agriculture or
flocks.</p>

<p>In southern Arabia the Jews form a large element in the town
population. According to one authority their presence in Yemen
dates from the time of Solomon, others say from the
capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadrezzar. Manzoni
<span class="sidenote">The Jews in Arabia.</span>
estimated their number in Sana in 1878 at 1700 out
of a total population of 20,000; at Aden they are a numerous
and wealthy community, with agents in most of the towns of
Yemen. Even in remote Nejran, Halévy, himself a Jew, found a
considerable colony of his co-religionists. They wear a distinctive
garb and are not allowed to carry arms or live in the same quarter
as Moslems. Another foreign element of considerable strength
in the coast towns of Muscat, Aden and Jidda, is the British
Indian trading class; many families of Indian origin also have
settled at Mecca, having originally come as pilgrims.</p>

<p>Estimates of the population of Arabia vary enormously, and
the figures given in the following table can only be regarded as a
very rough approximation:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;The principal land routes in Arabia are
those leading to the holy cities. In the present day the Syrian
pilgrim route, or Darb el Haj, from Damascus to Medina and
Mecca is the most used. The annual pilgrim caravan or haj,
numbering some 6000 people with 10,000 pack animals, is
escorted by a few Turkish irregulars known as <i>agel</i>; small
fortified posts have been established at the regular halting-places
some 30 m. apart, each furnished with a well and reservoir, and
for the further protection of the haj, payments are made to the
Bedouin tribes through whose territories the route passes. The
road is a mere camel track across the desert, the chief places
passed are Ma&rsquo;an on the Syrian border, a station on the old
Sabaean trade route to Petra, and Medain Salih, the site of the
rock-cut tombs and inscriptions first brought to notice by
Doughty. From Medina the route usually followed descends
the W. Safra to Badr Hunen, whence it keeps near the coast
passing Rabigh and Khulesa to Mecca. The total distance,
1300 m., is covered in forty days.</p>

<p>The Egyptian pilgrim route from Cairo, across the Sinai
peninsula and down the Midian coast to El Wijh, joins the
Syrian route at Badr Hunen. It also was formerly provided
with stations and reservoirs, but owing to the greater facilities
of the sea journey from Suez to Jidda it is now little used.
Another important route is that taken by the Persian or Shia
pilgrims from Bagdad and Kerbela across the desert, by the
wells of Lina, to Bureda in Kasim; thence across the steppes of
western Nejd till it crosses the Hejaz border at the Ria Mecca,
50 m. north-east of the city. It lies almost entirely in the
territory of the amir Ibn Rashid of J. Shammar, who derives a
considerable revenue from the pilgrimage. The old reservoirs
on this route attributed to Zubeda, wife of Harun al Rashid,
were destroyed during the Wahhabi raids early in the 19th
century, and have not been repaired. The Yemen pilgrim route,
known as the Haj el Kabsi, led from Sada through Asir to Taif
and Mecca, but it is no longer used.</p>

<p>The principal trade routes are those leading from Damascus to
Jauf and across the Nafud to Hail. Other important routes
leading to Nejd are those from Kuwet to Hail, and from El Hasa
to Riad respectively. In the west and south the principal routes,
other than those already mentioned, are from Yambu to Medina,
from Jidda to Mecca, Hodeda to Sana, Aden to Sana, and from
Mukalla to the Hadramut valley. Railway construction has
begun in Arabia, and in 1908 the Hejaz line, intended to connect
Damascus with Mecca, had reached Medina, 500 m. south of
Ma&rsquo;an. This line is of great strategical importance, as strengthening
the Turkish hold on the Red Sea provinces. But the principal
means of commercial communication for a country like Arabia
must always be by sea. Bahrein, Kuwet and Muscat are in steam
communication with India, and the Persian Gulf ports; all the
great lines of steamships call at Aden on their way between Suez
and the East, and regular services are maintained between Suez,
Jidda, Hodeda and Aden, as well as to the ports on the African
coast, while native coasting craft trade to the smaller ports on
the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Commerce.</i>&mdash;The total value of the trade of Aden for 1904
amounted to over £6,000,000. The imports to Jidda in the same
year were £1,405,000, largely consisting of rice, wheat and other food
stuffs from India; the exports, which have dwindled away in late
years, amounted in 1904 to only £25,000. To balance the exports
and imports specie was exported in the three years 1902-1904
amounting to £2,319,000; a large proportion of this was perhaps
provided by cash brought into the country by pilgrims.</p>

<p>The pilgrim traffic increased largely in 1904 as compared with
previous years; 74,600 persons landed at Jidda, 18,000 of whom
were from British India, 13,000 from Java and the Straits Settlements,
and the remainder from Turkish territory, Egypt and other
countries: 235 out of a total of 334 steamships engaged in this
traffic were British.</p>

<p>The trade of Hodeda, which contributes by far the largest share
to that of Turkish Yemen, fell off considerably during the period
from 1901-1905, chiefly owing to the disturbed state of the country.
In the latter year the imports amounted to £467,000, and the exports
to £451,000; coffee, the mainstay of Yemen trade, shows a serious
decline from £302,000 in 1902 to £229,000 in 1904; this is attributable
partly to the great increase of production in other countries, but
mainly to the insecurity of the trade routes and the exorbitant
transit dues levied by the Turkish administration.</p>

<p>Oman, through its chief port Muscat, had a total trade of about
£550,000, two-thirds of which is due to imports and one-third to
exports. The chief items of imports are arms and ammunition, rice,
coffee and piece goods; the staple export is dates, which in a good
year accounts for nearly half the total; much of the trade is in the
hands of British Indians, and of the shipping 92% is British.</p>

<p>The principal trade centre of the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf
is Bahrein; the total volume of trade of which amounted in 1904
to £1,900,000, nearly equally divided between imports and exports;
rice, piece goods, &amp;c., form the bulk of the former, while pearls are
the most valuable part of the latter.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Antiquities</p>

<p>Arabia cannot be said to be &ldquo;destitute of antiquities,&rdquo; but
the material for the study of these is still very incomplete.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>
The difficulties in the way of travelling in Arabia with a view
to scientific investigation are such that little or nothing is being
done, and the systematic work which has given such good results
in Egypt, Palestine and Babylonia-Assyria is unknown in Arabia.
Yet the passing notes of travellers from the time of Carsten
Niebuhr show that antiquities are to be found.</p>

<p><i>Prehistoric Remains.</i>&mdash;Since prehistoric remains must be
studied where they are found, the difficulty in the way of exploration
makes itself severely felt. That such remains exist
seems clear from the casual remarks of travellers. Thus Palgrave
(<i>Central and Eastern Arabia</i>, vol. i. ch. 6) speaks of part of a circle
of roughly shaped stones taken from the adjacent limestone
mountains in the Nejd. Eight or nine of these stones still
exist, some of them 15 ft. high. Two of them, 10 to 12 ft. apart,
still bear their horizontal lintel. They are all without ornament.
Palgrave compares them with the remains at Stonehenge and
Karnak. Doughty (<i>Arabia Deserta</i>, vol. ii.), travelling in north-west
Arabia, saw stones of granite in a row and &ldquo;flagstones set
edgewise&rdquo; (though he does not regard these as religious), also
&ldquo;round heaps, perhaps barrows,&rdquo; and &ldquo;dry-built round
chambers,&rdquo; which may be ancient tombs. J.T. Bent (<i>Southern
Arabia</i>, pp. 24 ff.) explored one of several mounds in Bahrein.
It proved to be a tomb, and the remains in it are said to be
Phoenician.</p>

<p><i>Castles and Walls.</i>&mdash;In the south of Arabia, where an advanced
civilization existed for centuries before the Christian era, the
ruins of castles and city-walls are still in existence, and have been
mentioned, though not examined carefully, by several travellers.
In Yemen and Hadramut especially these ruins abound, and in
some cases inscriptions seem to be still <i>in situ</i>. Great castles
are often mentioned in early Arabian literature. One in the
neighbourhood of San&#8219;a was described as one of the wonders of
the world by Qazw&#299;n&#299; (<i>Ath&#257;r ul-Bil&#257;d</i>, p. 33, ed. Wüstenfeld,
Göttingen, 1847, cf. <i>Journal of the German Oriental Society</i>,
vol. 7, pp. 472, 476, and for other castles vol. 10, pp. 20 ff.).
The ruins of the city of Ma&rsquo;rib, the old Sabaean capital, have
been visited by Arnaud, Halévy and Glaser, but call for further
description, as Arnaud confined himself to a description of the
dike (see below), while Halévy and Glaser were interested chiefly
in the inscriptions.</p>

<p><i>Wells and Dikes.</i>&mdash;From the earliest times the conservation
of water has been one of the serious cares of the Arabs. All over
the country wells are to be found, and the masonry of some of
them is undoubtedly ancient. Inscriptions are still found in
some of these in the south. The famous well Zemzem at Mecca
is said to belong to the early times, when the eastern traffic
passed from the south to the north-west of Arabia through the
Hejaz, and to have been rediscovered shortly before the time of
Mahomet. Among the most famous remains of Ma&rsquo;rib are those
of a great dike reminding one of the restored tanks familiar to
visitors at Aden. These remains were first described by Arnaud
(<i>Journal asiatique</i>, January 1874, with plan). Their importance
was afterwards emphasized by Glaser&rsquo;s publication of two long
inscriptions concerning their restoration in the 5th and 6th
centuries <span class="scs">A.D.</span> (&ldquo;Zwei Inschriften über den Dammbruch von
Marib,&rdquo; in the <i>Mitteilungen der Vorderasiatischen Gesellschaft</i>,
Berlin, 1897). Another dike about 150 yds. long was seen by
W.B. Harris at Hîrran in Yemen. Above it was a series of three
tanks (<i>A Journey through the Yemen</i>, p. 279, London, 1893).</p>

<p><i>Stones and Bronzes.</i>&mdash;The 19th century has brought to the
museums of Europe (especially to London, Paris, Berlin and
Vienna) a number of inscriptions in the languages of Minea and
Saba, and a few in those of Hadramut and Katabania (Qatta-bania).
These inscriptions are generally on limestone or marble
or on tablets of bronze, and vary from a few inches to some
feet in length and height. In some cases the originals have been
brought to Europe, in other cases only squeezes of the inscriptions.
The characters employed are apparently derived from
the Phoenician (cf. Lidzbarski&rsquo;s <i>Ephemeris</i>, vol. i. pp. 109 ff.).
The languages employed have been the subject of much study
(cf. F. Hommel&rsquo;s <i>Süd-arabische Chrestomathie</i>, Munich, 1893),
but the archaeological value of these remains has not been so
fully treated. Very many of them are votive inscriptions and
contain little more than the names of gods and princes or private
men. A few are historical, but being (with few and late exceptions)
undated, have given rise to much controversy among
scholars. Their range seems to be from about 800 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (or 1500
<span class="scs">B.C.</span> according to E. Glaser) to the 6th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Few are
still <i>in situ</i>, the majority having been taken from their original
positions and built into houses, mosques or wells of more recent
date. Among these remains are altars, and bases for statues
of gods or for golden images of animals dedicated to gods. The
earlier stones are devoid of ornamentation, but the later stones
and bronzes are sometimes ornamented with designs of leaves,
flowers, ox-heads, men and women. Some bear figures of the
conventionalized sacred tree with worshippers, similar to
Babylonian designs. Besides these there are gravestones, stelae
with human heads, fragments of limestone, architectural designs
as well as bronze castings of camels, horses, mice, serpents, &amp;c.
(cf. D.H. Müller&rsquo;s <i>Südarabische Alterthümer im Kunsthistorischen
Museum</i>, Vienna, 1899, with plates).</p>

<p><i>Seals, Weights and Coins.</i>&mdash;The Vienna Museum possesses a
small number of seals and gems. The seals are inscribed with
Sabaean writing and are of bronze, copper, silver and stone.
The gems of onyx, carnelian and agate are later and bear various
figures, and in some cases Arabic inscriptions. One or two
weights are also in existence. A number of coins have been
brought to the British Museum from Aden, San&rsquo;a and Ma&rsquo;rib.
Others were purchased by G. Schlumberger in Constantinople;
others have been brought to Europe by Glaser, and are now in
the Vienna Museum. These are imitations of Greek models,
while the inscriptions are in Sabaean characters (cf. B.V. Head,
in the <i>Numismatic Chronicle</i>, 1878, pp. 273-284; G. Schlumberger,
<i>Le Trêsor de San&#8219;a</i>, Paris, 1880; D.H. Müller, <i>op. cit.</i>
pp. 65 ff. and plates).</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">History</p>

<p><i>Introduction.</i>&mdash;Arabia is a land of Semites, and is supposed by
some scholars to have been the original home of the Semitic
peoples. Although this cannot be said to be proved, the studies,
linguistic and archaeological, of Semitic scholars have shown
it to be probable. The dispersion from Arabia is easy to imagine.
The migration into Babylonia was simple, as there are no natural
boundaries to separate it from north-east Arabia, and similar
migrations have taken place in historic times. That of the
Aramaeans at an early period is likewise free from any natural
hindrance. The connexion with Palestine has always been close;
and the Abyssinian settlement is probably as late as the beginning
of the Christian era. Of these migrations, however, history knows
nothing, nor are they expressed in literature. Arabian literature
has its own version of prehistoric times, but it is entirely
legendary and apocryphal. It was, and still is, the custom of
Arabian historians to begin with the creation of the world and
tell the history from then to the time of which they are writing.
Consequently even the more sober histories contain a mass of
fables about early days. Many of these, taken in part from
Jewish and Christian sources, find a place in the Koran. Of all
these stories current at the time of Mahomet, the only ones of
any value are the accounts of the &ldquo;days of the Arabs,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
accounts of some famous inter-tribal battles in Arabia.</p>

<p><i>Authorities.</i>&mdash;Until recently the Arab traditions were practically
the only source for the pre-Islamic history of Arabia. The
Old Testament references to Arabs were obscure. The classical
accounts of the invasion of Aelius Callus in 26 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> threw little
light on the state of Arabia at the time, still less on its past
history. The Greek writers from Theophrastus in the 4th
century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> to Ptolemy in the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> mention many
names of Arabian peoples and describe the situation of their
cities, but contribute little to their history, and that little could
not be controlled. The same applies to the information of Pliny
in his <i>Natural History</i>. In the 19th century the discovery
and decipherment of the Assyrian inscriptions gave a slight
glance into the relations between Arabs and Assyrians from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>
8th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> But the great contribution of the century to
the early history of Arabia was the collecting and translating
of numerous early Arabian inscriptions (cf. section <i>Antiquities</i>
above), which have done service both by their own indication of
a great civilization in Arabia for nearly (or more than) a thousand
years before the Christian era, and by the new stimulus which
they gave to the study and appreciation of the materials in the
Assyrian inscriptions, the Old Testament, and the Greek and
Roman writers. At the same time the facts that the inscriptions
are undated until a late period, that few are historical in their
contents, and for the most part yield only names of gods and
rulers and domestic and religious details, and that our collection
is still very incomplete, have led to much serious disagreement
among scholars as to the reconstruction of the history of Arabia
in the pre-Christian centuries.</p>

<p>All scholars, however, are agreed that the inscriptions reach as
far back as the 9th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (some say to the 16th) and prove
the existence of at least four civilized kingdoms during these
centuries. These are the kingdoms of Ma&#8219;&#299;n (Minaean), of
Saba (Sabaean), of Hadramaut (Hadramut) and of Katabania
(Kataban&#363;). Of the two latter little is known. That of Hadramut
had kings from the time of the Minaeans to about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 300, when
it was conquered by Ethiopia. The limits of the kingdom of
Katabania are not known, but it has its own inscriptions.</p>

<p>As to the Sabaean kingdom there is fair agreement among
scholars. The inscriptions go back to 800 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> or earlier, and
the same applies to the kingdom. A queen of this people (the
&ldquo;Queen of Sheba&rdquo;) is said (1 Kings x.) to have visited Solomon
about 950 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> There is, however, no mention of such a queen
in the inscriptions. An Assyrian inscription mentions Ith&#8219;amara
the Sabaean who paid tribute to Sargon in 715 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> At this time
the Sabaeans must have been in north Arabia unless the inscription
refers to a northern colony of the southern Sabaeans.
The former opinion is held by E. Glaser, who thinks that in the
9th and 8th centuries they moved down along the west coast to
the south, where they conquered the Minaeans (see below).
The Sabaean rule is generally divided into periods indicated by
the titles given to their rulers. In the first of these ruled the
Makarib, who seem to have been priest-kings. Their first capital
was at &#7778;irw&#257;&#7717;. Ten such rulers are mentioned in the inscriptions.
Their rule extended from the 9th to the 6th century. The second
period begins about 550 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The rulers are known as &ldquo;kings of
Saba.&rdquo; Their capital was Ma&rsquo;rib. The names of seventeen of
these kings are known from the inscriptions. Their sway lasted
until about 115 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, when they were succeeded by the Himyarites.
During this period they were engaged in constant strife
with the neighbouring kingdoms of Hadramut and Katabania.
The great prosperity of south-west Arabia at this time was due
in large measure to the fact that the trade from India with Egypt
came there by sea and then went by land up the west coast.
This trade, however, was lost during this period, as the Ptolemies
established an overland route from India to Alexandria. The
connexion of Saba with the north, where the Nabataeans (<i>q.v.</i>)
had existed from about 200 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, was now broken. The decay
that followed caused a number of Sabaeans to migrate to other
parts of Arabia.</p>

<p>The Minaean kingdom extended over the south Arabian
Jauf, its chief cities being Karnau, Ma&#8219;&#299;n and Yathil. Some
twenty-five kings are known from the inscriptions; of these
twenty are known to be related to one another. Their history
must thus cover several centuries. As inscriptions in the Minaean
language are found in al-&rsquo;Ula in north Arabia, it is probable that
they had colonies in that district. With regard to their date
opinion is very much divided; some, with E. Glaser and
F. Hommel, maintaining that their kingdom existed prior to
that of Saba, probably from about 1500 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> or earlier until the
Sabaeans came from their home in the north and conquered
them in the 9th century. Other scholars think, with D.H.
Müller, partly on palaeographical grounds (cf. M. Lidzbarski&rsquo;s
<i>Ephemeris</i>, vol. i. pp. 109 seq., Giessen, 1902), that none of the
inscriptions are earlier than about 800 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> and that the Minaean
kingdom existed side by side with the Sabaean. It is curious that
the Sabaean inscriptions contain no mention of the Minaeans,
though this may be due to the fact that very few of the inscriptions
are historical in content.</p>

<p>About 115 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the power over south Arabia passed from the
Sabaeans to the Himyarites, a people from the extreme south-west
of Arabia; and about this time the kingdom of Katabania
came to an end. The title taken by the new rulers was &ldquo;king of
Saba and Raidan.&rdquo; Twenty-six kings of this period are known
from the inscriptions, some of which are dated. In this period
the Romans made their one attempt at direct interference in the
affairs of Arabia. The invasion under Aelius Gallus was an
absolute failure, the expedition being betrayed by the guides
and lost in the sands of the desert. During the latter part of
this time the Abyssinians, who had earlier migrated from Arabia
to the opposite coast of Africa, began to flow back to the south
of Arabia, where they seem to have settled gradually and
increased in importance until about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 300, when they became
strong enough to overturn the Himyarite kings and establish a
dynasty of their own. The title assumed by them was &ldquo;king of
Saba, Raid&#257;n, Hadramut and Yemen.&rdquo; The Himyarites were,
however, still active, and after a struggle succeeded in establishing
a Jewish Sabaean kingdom, having previously accepted
Judaism as their religion. Their best-known king was Dhu
Nuwas. The struggle between them and the Abyssinians now
became one of Judaism against Christianity. The persecution
of the Christians was very severe (see E. Glaser&rsquo;s <i>Die Abyssinier
in Arabien und Afrika</i>, Munich, 1895, and F.M.E. Pereira&rsquo;s
<i>Historia dos Martyres de Nagran</i>, Lisbon, 1899). Apparently for
this reason Christian Abyssinia was supported from Byzantium
in its attempts to regain power. These attempts were crowned
with success in 525. Of the Christian Abyssinian kings in Arabia
tradition tells of four, one only of whom is mentioned in inscriptions.
The famous expedition of Abraha, the Abyssinian viceroy,
against Mecca, took place in 570. Five years later the Persians,
who had been called in by the opponents of Christianity, succeeded
in taking over the rule and in appointing governors over
Yemen. (See further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ethiopia</a></span>: <i>The Axumite Kingdom</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Hira, Ghass&#257;n and Kinda.</i>&mdash;Before passing to the time of
Mahomet it is necessary to take account of three other Arabian
powers, those of Hira, Ghassan and Kinda.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Hira (&#7716;&#299;ra) was established in the boundary
land between the Euphrates and the Arabian desert, a district
renowned for its good air and extraordinary fertility.
The chief town was Hira, a few miles south of the site
<span class="sidenote">Hira.</span>
of the later town of Kufa. The inhabitants of this land are said
in Tabari&rsquo;s history to have been of three classes:&mdash;(1) The
Tanukh (Tnuhs), who lived in tents and were made up of Arabs
from the Tehama and Nejd, who had united in Bahrein to form
a new tribe, and who migrated from there to H&#299;ra, probably at
the beginning or middle of the 3rd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, when the
Arsacid power was growing weak. The Arabian historians relate
their conflict with Zenobia. (2) The &#8219;Ib&#257;d or &#8219;Ib&#257;dites, who
dwelt in the town of Hira in houses and so led a settled life.
These were Christians, whose ecclesiastical language was Syriac,
though the language of intercourse was Arabic. A Christian
bishop of Hira is known to have attended a synod in 410. In
the 5th century they became Nestorians. (3) Refugees of various
tribes, who came into the land but did not belong to the Tanukh
or the &#8219;Ibad. There is no trustworthy information as to the
earlier chiefs of this people. The dynasty of the Lakhmids,
famed in Arabian history and literature, arose towards the end
of the 3rd century and lasted until about 602. The names of
twenty kings are given by Hish&#257;m al-Kalb&#299; in &#7788;abari&rsquo;s history.
Although so many of their subjects were Christian, the Lakhmids
remained heathen until Nu&rsquo;m&#257;n, the last of the dynasty. The
kingdom of H&#299;ra was never really independent, but always stood
in a relation of dependence on Persia, probably receiving pay
from it and employing Persian soldiers. At the height of its
power it was able to render valuable aid to its suzerain. Much
of its time was spent in wars with Rome and Ghass&#257;n. Its
revenues were derived from the Bedouins of the surrounding
lands as well as from its own subjects at home. About 602 the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
Lakhmid dynasty fell, and the Persian Chosroes (Khosrau) II.
appointed as governor an Arab of the tribe of T&#257;i. Shortly after
it came into relation with Islam.</p>

</div>

<p>In the beginning of the 6th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> a dynasty known as
the Jafnids, enter into the history alike of the Roman and
Persian empires. They ruled over the tribe of Ghass&#257;n
in the extreme north-west of Arabia, east of the
<span class="sidenote">Ghass&#257;n.</span>
Jordan, from near Petra in the south to the neighbourhood of
Rosafa in the north-east. Of their origin little is known except
that they came from the south. A part of the same tribe inhabited
Yathrib (Medina) at the time of Mahomet. The first
certain prince of the Jafnid house was Harith ibn Jabala, who,
according to the chronicle of John Malalas, conquered Mondhir
(Mundhir) of Hira in 528. In the following year, according to
Procopius, Justinian perceived the value of the Ghass&#257;nids as an
outpost of the Roman empire, and as opponents of the Persian
dependants of H&#299;ra, and recognized H&#257;rith as king of the Arabs
and patrician of the Roman empire. He was thus constantly
engaged in battles against H&#299;ra. In 541 he fought under Belisarius
in Mesopotamia. After his death about 569 or 570 the
friendly relations with the West continued, but about 583 there
was a breach. The Ghassanid kingdom split into sections each
with its own prince. Some passed under the sway of Persia,
others preserved their freedom at the expense of their neighbours.
At this point their history ceases to be mentioned in the Western
chronicles. There are references to the Ghass&#257;nid Nu&rsquo;m&#257;n in the
poems of N&#257;bigha. Arabian tradition tells of their prince
Jabala ibn Aiham who accepted Islam, after fighting against
it, but finding it too democratic, returned to Christianity and
exile in the Roman empire. As Islam advanced, some of the
Ghass&#257;nids retreated to Cappadocia, others accepted the new
faith.</p>

<p>In the last decade of the 5th century a new power arose in
central Arabia. This was the tribe of Kinda under the sway of
the family of Aqil ul Mur&#257;r, who came from the south.
They seem to have stood in much the same relation to
<span class="sidenote">Kinda.</span>
the rulers of Yemen, as the people of H&#299;ra to the Persians and
the Ghassanids to Rome. Abraha in his invasion of the Hejaz
was accompanied by chiefs of Kinda. Details of their history
are not known, but they seem to have gained power at one time
even over the Lakhmids of H&#299;ra; and to have ruled over
Bahrein as well as Yemama until the battle of Shi&#8219;b ul Jabala,
when they lost this province to Hira. The poet Amru&#8219;ul Qais
was a member of the princely family of Kinda.</p>

<p>Outside the territory of the powers mentioned above, Arabia
in the 6th century was in a state of political chaos. Bahrein,
inhabited chiefly by the Bani&#8219;Abd Qais and the Bani
Bakr, was largely subject to Persian influence near
<span class="sidenote">Other parts of Arabia.</span>
its coast, and a Persian governor, Sebocht, resided
in Hajar, its chief town. In Oman the Arabs, who
were chiefly engaged in fishing and seafaring, were Azdites
mixed with Persians. The ruling dynasty of Julanda in their
capital Suhar lasted on till the Abbasid period. No Persian
officials are mentioned in this country; whether Persians exercised
authority over it is doubtful. On the west coast of Arabia
the influence of the kingdom of Yemen was felt in varying degree
according to the strength of the rulers of that land. Apart from
this influence the Hejaz was simply a collection of cities each
with its own government, while outside the cities the various
tribes governed themselves and fought continual battles with
one another.</p>

<p><i>Time of Mahomet.</i>&mdash;Thus at the time of Mahomet&rsquo;s advent
the country was peopled by various tribes, some more or less
settled under the governments of south Arabia, Kinda, Hira and
Ghassan, these in turn depending on Abyssinia, Persia and
Rome (<i>i.e.</i> Byzantium); others as in the Hejaz were ruled in
smaller communities by members of leading families, while
in various parts of the peninsula were wandering Arabs still
maintaining the traditions of old family and tribal rule, forming
no state, sometimes passing, as suited them, under the influence
and protection of one or another of the greater powers. To these
may be added a certain number of Jewish tribes and families
deriving their origin partly from migrations from Palestine,
partly from converts among the Arabs themselves. Mahomet
appealed at once to religion and patriotism, or rather created a
feeling for both. For Mahomet as a religious teacher and for the
details of his career see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahomet</a></span>. It is enough here to outline
his actions in so far as he attempted to create a united, and then
a conquering, Arabia. Though the external conquests of the
Arabs belong more properly to the period of the caliphate, yet
they were the natural outcome of the prophet&rsquo;s ideas. His idea
of Arabia for the Arabians could only be realized by summoning
the great kings of the surrounding nations to recognize Islam;
otherwise Abyssinia, Persia and Rome (Byzantium) would
continue their former endeavours to influence and control the
affairs of the peninsula. Tradition tells that a few years before
his death he did actually send letters to the emperor Heraclius,
to the negus of Abyssinia, the king of Persia, and Cyrus, patriarch
of Alexandria, the &ldquo;Mukaukis&rdquo; of Egypt, summoning them to
accept Islam and threatening them with punishment in case of
refusal. But the task of carrying out these threats fell to the lot
of his successors; the work of the prophet was to be the subjugating
and uniting of Arabia. This work, scarcely begun in Mecca,
was really started after the migration to Medina by the formation
of a party of men&mdash;the <i>Muh&#257;jirun</i> (Refugees or Emigrants)
and the <i>Ans&#257;r</i> (Helpers or Defenders)&mdash;who accepted Mahomet
as their religious leader. As the necessity of overcoming his
enemies became urgent, this party became military. A few
successes in battle attracted to him men who were interested in
fighting and who were willing to accept his religion as a condition
of membership of his party, which soon began to assume a
national form. Mahomet early found an excuse for attacking
the Jews, who were naturally in the way of his schemes. The
Bani Nad&#299;r were expelled, the Bani Quraiza slaughtered. By the
time he had successfully stormed the rich Jewish town of Khaibar,
he had found that it was better to allow industrious Jews to
remain in Arabia as payers of tribute than to expel or kill them:
this policy he followed afterwards. The capture of Mecca (630)
was not only an evidence of his growing power, which induced
Arabs throughout the peninsula to join him, but gave him a valuable
centre of pilgrimage, in which he was able by a politic adoption
of some of the heathen Arabian ceremonies into his own rites to
win men over the more easily to his own cause. At his death in
623 Mahomet left Arabia practically unified. It is true that rival
prophets were leading rebellions in various parts of Arabia,
that the tax-collectors were not always paid, and that the
warriors of the land were much distressed for want of work
owing to the brotherhood of Arabs proclaimed by Mahomet.
The tribes were a seething mass of restlessness, their old feuds
ready to break out again. But they had realized that they had
common interests. The power of the foreigner in Arabia was
broken. Islam promised rich booty for those who fought and
won, paradise for those who fell.</p>

<p><i>Early Caliphs</i>.<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> I. <i>Conquest.</i>&mdash;One task of the early caliphs
was to find an outlet for the restless fighting spirit. Abu Bekr
(632-634), the first of these caliphs, was a man of simple life and
profound faith. He understood the intention of Mahomet as to
foreign nations, and set himself resolutely to carry it out in the
face of much difficulty. Hence as soon as he assumed office he
sent out the army already chosen to advance against the Romans
in the north. The successful reduction of the rebels in Arabia
enabled him in his first year to send his great general Kh&#257;lid
with his Arab warriors first against Persians, then against
Romans. His early death prevented him from seeing the fruits
of his policy. Under the second caliph Omar (634-644) the
Persians were defeated at Kadesiya (Kadessia), and Irak was
completely subdued and the new cities of Kufa and Basra were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>
founded (635). In the same year Damascus fell into the hands
of the Arabs under Abu &#8219;Ubaida. In 636 Jerusalem fell and
received a visit from the caliph. Three years later the fateful
step was taken of appointing Moawiya (Mu&rsquo;aw&#299;yya) governor of
Syria. In 640 &#8219;Amr-ibn-el-Ass (Amr ibn al-&#8219;&#256;s) invaded Egypt
and the following year took Alexandria and founded Fostat
(which later became Cairo). The victory at Nehavend in 641
over the Persians, the flight of the last Sassanid king and the
capture of Rei or Rai (class. Rhagae) in 643 meant the entire
subjugation of Persia and crowned the conquests of Omar&rsquo;s
caliphate. The reign of the third caliph Othman (644-656) was
marked by the beginning of that internal strife which was to
ruin Arabia; but the foreign conquests continued. In the north
the Moslem arms reached Armenia and Asia Minor; on the west
they were successful as far as Carthage on the north coast of
Africa. After the murder of Othman, &#8219;Ali (656-661) became
caliph, but Moawiya, governor of Syria, soon rebelled on the
pretext of avenging the death of Othman. After the battle of
Siffin (657) arbitration was resorted to for the settlement of the
rival claims. By a trick &#8219;Ali was deposed (658), and the Omayyad
dynasty was established with its capital at Damascus.</p>

<p>During these early years the Arabs had not only made conquests
by land, but had found an outlet for their energy at sea.
In 640 Omar sent a fleet of boats across the Red Sea
to protect the Moslems on the Abyssinian coast.
<span class="sidenote">Institution of navy.</span>
The boats were wrecked. Omar was so terrified by
this that when Moawiya applied to him for permission to use
ships for an attack on the islands of the Levant, he resolutely
refused. Othman was less careful, and allowed a fleet from
Africa to help in the conquests of the Levant and Asia Minor.
In 649 he sanctioned the establishment of a maritime service,
on condition that it should be voluntary. Abu Qais, appointed
admiral, showed its usefulness by the capture of Cyprus. In 652
Abu Sarh with a fleet from Egypt won a naval battle over the
Byzantine fleet near Alexandria.</p>

<p>2. <i>Internal Affairs.</i>&mdash;In the meantime what had become of
Arabia and its unification? The first task of Abu Bekr had
been to reduce those rebels who threatened to destroy that unity
even before it was fully established. This he did by the aid of
the great general Kh&#257;lid. First he swept down on the Bani
Han&#299;fa in Yem&#257;ma, who with their rival prophet Mosailama
(Mosailima) and 40,000 men were in arms. The battle of
Yemama (633) was fierce and decisive. Mosailama was slain.
The Bani Han&#299;fa returned to Islam. Bahrein was influenced by
this battle, and the rebellion there, which was threatening, was
crushed. Oman was reconquered by Huddhaifa, who became its
governor. Ikrima settled M&#257;hra. Muh&#257;jir, with the help of
Ikrima, succeeded with difficulty, but thoroughly, in defeating
Amr ibn Ma&rsquo;dikarib and Qais ibn &#8219;Abd Yagh&#363;th in Yemen and
Ashath ibn Qais in Hadramut. The Hejaz and Tehama were
cleared of the plundering nomads by &#8219;Att&#257;b and &#7788;&#257;hir. At the
end of the first year of his caliphate Abu Bekr saw Arabia united
under Islam. The new national feeling demanded that all
Arabs should be free men, so the caliph ordained that all Arab
slaves should be freed on easy terms. The solidarity of Arabia
survived the first foreign conquests. It was not intended that
Arabs should settle in the conquered lands except as armies of
occupation. Thus it was at first forbidden that Arabs should
buy or possess land in these countries. K&#363;fa was to be only a
military camp, as was Fostat in Egypt. The taxes with the booty
from conquests were to be sent to Arabia for distribution among
the Moslems. Omar tried to prevent the advance of conquests
lest Arabia should suffer. &ldquo;I would rather the safety of my
people than thousands of spoil and further conquest.&rdquo; But
men could not be prevented from pouring out from their homes
in search of new conquests and more booty. Many of those who
went forth did not return. They acquired property and rank in
the new lands. K&#363;fa attracted chiefly men of south Arabia,
Basra those of the north. Both became great cities, each with
a population of 150,000 to 200,000 Arabians. Yet so long as the
caliphs lived in Medina, the capital of Arabia was the capital
of the expanding Arabian empire. To it was brought a large
share of the booty. The caliphs were chosen there, and there the
rules for the administration were framed. Thence went out the
governors to their provinces. Omar was the great organizer
of Arabian affairs. He compiled the Koran, instituted the civil
list, regulated the military organization. He, too, desired that
Mahomet&rsquo;s wish should be carried out and that Arabia should be
purely Moslem. To this end he expelled the Christians from
Nejr&#257;n and gave them lands in Syria and Irak, where they were
allowed to live in peace on payment of tribute. The Jews, too,
were shortly after expelled from Khaibar. The secondary position
that Arabia was beginning to assume in the Arabian empire
is clearly marked in the progress of events during the caliphate
of Othman. In his appointments to governorships and other
offices, as well as in his distribution of spoil, Othman showed a
marked preference for the members of his own tribe the Koreish
(Quraish) and the members of his own family the Bani Omayya
(Umayya). The other Arab tribes became increasingly jealous
of the Koreish, while among the Koreish themselves the H&#257;shimite
family came to hate the Omayyad, which now had much
power, although it had been among the last to accept Islam and
never was very strict in its religious duties. But the quarrels
which led to the murder of Othm&#257;n were fomented not so much
in Arabia as in K&#363;fa and Ba&#7779;ra and Fostat. In these cities the
rival parties were composed of the most energetic fighting men,
who were brought into the most intimate contact with one
another, and who kept up their quarrels from the home land.
In K&#363;fa a number of the Koreish had settled, and their arrogance
became insupportable. The governors of all these towns were of
Othman&rsquo;s own family. After some years of growing dissatisfaction
deputies from these places came to Medina, and the result
was the murder of the caliph. Syria alone remained loyal to the
house of Omayya, and Othm&#257;n had been advised to take refuge
there, but had refused. Arabia itself counted for little in the
strife. Yet its prestige was not altogether lost. After the
murder the rebels were unwilling to return home until a new
caliph had been chosen in the capital. The Egyptian rebels
managed to gain most influence, and, in accordance with their
desire, &#8219;Al&#299; was appointed caliph by the citizens of Medina.
But Medina itself was being corrupted by the constant influx of
captives, who, employed at first as servants, soon became
powerful enough to dictate to their masters. In the struggle that
ensued upon the election of &#8219;Al&#299;, Arabia was involved. Ayesha,
&#7788;al&#7717;a and Zobair, who were strong in Mecca, succeeded in
obtaining possession of Ba&#7779;ra, but were defeated in 656 at the
battle of the Camel (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ali</a></span>). In the south of Arabia &#8219;Al&#299; succeeded
in establishing his own governor in Yemen, though the
government treasure was carried off to Mecca. But the centre
of strife was not to be Arabia. When &#8219;Al&#299; left Medina to secure
Basra, he abandoned it as the capital of the Arabian empire.
With the success of Moawiya Damascus became the capital of
the caliphate (658) and Arabia became a mere province, though
always of importance because of its possession of the two sacred
cities Mecca and Medina. Both these cities were secured by
Moawiya in 660, and at the same time Yemen was punished for
its adherence to &#8219;Al&#299;. The final blow to any political pretensions
of Medina was dealt by the caliph when he had his son Yaz&#299;d
declared as his successor, thus taking away any claim on the
part of the citizens of Medina to elect to the caliphate.</p>

<p><i>The Omayyads.</i>&mdash;The early years of the Omayyads were years
of constant strife in Arabia. The Kharijites who had opposed
&#8219;Al&#299; on the ground that he had no right to allow the appeal to
arbitration, were defeated at Nahraw&#257;n or Nahrw&#257;n (658), but
those who escaped became fierce propagandists against the
Koreish, some claiming that the caliph should be chosen by the
Faithful from any tribe of the Arabs, some that there should
be no caliph at all, that God alone was their ruler and that the
government should be carried on by a council. They broke up
into many sects, and were long a disturbing political force in
Arabia as elsewhere. On the death of &#8219;Al&#299; his house was represented
by his two sons &#7716;asan and &#7716;osain (&#7716;usain). &#7716;asan
soon made peace with Moawiya. On the accession of Yazid,
&#7716;osain refused homage and raised an army, but was slain at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span>
Kerbela (680). &#8219;&#256;bdallah ibn Zobair (of the house of Hashim)
immediately stepped forward in Mecca as the avenger of &#8219;Al&#299;&rsquo;s
family and the champion of religion. The two sacred cities
supported him. Medina was besieged and sacked by the troops
of Yaz&#299;d (682) and Mecca was besieged the following year. The
siege was raised in the third month on the news of the death of
Yaz&#299;d, but not before the Ka&#8219;ba had been destroyed. &#8219;&#256;bdallah
remained in Mecca recognized as caliph in Arabia, and soon
after in Egypt and even a part of Syria. He defeated the troops
of Merw&#257;n I., but could not win the support of the Kh&#257;rijites.
In 691 Abdalmalik (&#8219;Abdul-Malik) determined to crush his
rival and sent his general Hajj&#257;j against Mecca. The siege was
begun in March 692, and in October the city was taken and
&#8219;&#256;bdallah slain. Abdalmalik was now supreme in Arabia and
throughout the Moslem world. During the remaining years
of the Omayyad dynasty (<i>i.e.</i> until 750) little is heard of Arabia
in history. The conquests of Islam in Spain on the one side
and India on the other had little or no effect on it. It was merely
a province.</p>

<p><i>The &#8219;Abb&#257;sids.</i>&mdash;The accession of Abul &#8219;Abb&#257;s (of the house
of H&#257;shim) and the transference of the capital of the caliphate
from Damascus to K&#363;fa, then Anbar and soon after (in 760)
to Bagdad meant still further degradation to Arabia and Arabs.
From the beginning the &#8219;Abb&#257;sids depended for help on Persians
and Turks, and the chief offices of state were frequently filled
with foreigners. In one thing only the Arabs conquered to the
end; that was in their language. The study of Arabic was taken
up by lexicographers, grammarians and poets (mostly of foreign
origin) with a zeal rarely shown elsewhere. The old Arabian
war spirit was dying. Although the Arabians, as a rule, were in
favour of the Omayyad family, they could not affect the succession
of the &#8219;Abb&#257;sids. They returned more and more to their
old inter-tribal disputes. They formed now not only a mere
branch of the empire of the caliphate, but a branch deriving
little life from and giving less to the main stock. In 762 there
was a rebellion in favour of a descendant of &#8219;Al&#299;, but it was put
down with great severity by the army of the caliph Man&#7779;&#363;r.
A more local &#8219;Alyite revolt in Mecca and Medina was crushed
in 785. In the contest between the two sons of Har&#363;n al Rash&#299;d
all Arabia sided with Mam&#363;n (812). In 845-846 the lawless
raids of Bedouin tribes compelled the caliph W&#257;thiq to send
his Turkish general Bogha, who was more successful in the north
than in the centre and south of Arabia in restoring peace.</p>

<p><i>The Carmathians.</i>&mdash;Towards the close of the 9th century
Arabia was disturbed by the rise of a new movement which during
the next hundred years dominated the peninsula, and at its
close left it shattered never to be united again. In the year
880 Yemen was listening to the propaganda of the new sect of
the Carmathians (<i>q.v.</i>) or followers of Hamd&#257;n Qarma&#7789;. Four
years later these had become a public force. In 900 &#8219;Ab&#363; Sa&#8219;id
al-Jann&#257;bi, who had been sent to Bahrein by Hamd&#257;n, had secured
a large part of this province and had won the city of Ka&#7789;if (Ketif)
which contained many Jews and Persians. The Arabs who
lived more inland were mostly Bedouin who found the obligations
of Islam irksome, and do not seem to have made a very vigorous
opposition to the Carmathians who took Hajar the capital of
Bahrein in 903. From this they made successful attacks on
Yem&#257;ma (Yamama), and attempts only partially successful
at first at Oman. In 906 the court at Bagdad learned that
these sectaries had gained almost all Yemen and were threatening
Mecca and Medina. Ab&#363; Sa&#8219;&#299;d was assassinated (913) in his
palace at La&#7717;sa (which in 926 was fortified and became the
Carmathian capital of Bahrein). His son Sa&#8219;&#299;d succeeded him,
but proved too weak and was deposed and succeeded by his
brother Abu &#7788;&#257;hir. His success was constant and the caliphate
was brought very low by him. In Arabia he subjugated Oman,
and swooping down on the west in 929 he horrified the Moslem
world by capturing Mecca and carrying off the sacred black
stone to Bahrein. The Fatimite caliph &#8219;Obaidallah (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fatimites</a></span>),
to whom Abu Tahir professed allegiance, publicly wrote
to him to restore the stone, but there is some reason to believe
that he secretly encouraged him to retain it. In 939, however,
the stone was restored and pilgrimages to the holy cities were
allowed to pass unmolested on payment of a tax. So long as
Ab&#363; &#7788;&#257;hir lived the Carmathians controlled Arabia. After
his death, however, they quarrelled with the Fatimite rulers
of Egypt (969) and began to lose their influence. In 985 they
were completely defeated in Irak, and soon after lost control
of the pilgrimages. Oman recovered its independence. Three
years later Ka&#7789;&#299;f, at that time their chief city, was besieged
and taken by a Bedouin sheik, and subsequently their political
power in Arabia came to an end. It was significant that their
power fell into the hands of Bedouins. Arabia was now completely
disorganized, and was only nominally subject to the
caliphate. The attempt of Mahomet to unify Arabia had
failed. The country was once more split up into small governments,
more or less independent, and groups of wandering tribes
carrying on their petty feuds. Of the history of these during
the next few centuries little is known, except in the case of the
Hejaz. Here the presence of the sacred cities led writers to
record their annals (cf. F. Wüstenfeld&rsquo;s <i>Die Chroniken der
Stadt Mekka</i>, 4 vols., Leipzig, 1857-1861). The two cities were
governed by Arabian nobles (<i>sher&#299;fs</i>), often at feud with one
another, recognizing formally the overlordship of the caliph
at Bagdad or the caliph of Egypt. Thus in 966 the name of the
caliph Moti was banished from the prayers at Mecca, and an
&#8219;Alyite took possession of the government of the city and recognized
the Egyptian caliph as his master. About a century later
(1075-1094) the &#8219;Abb&#257;sid caliph was again recognized as spiritual
head owing to the success in arms of his protector, the Seljuk
Malik-Shah. With the fall of the Bagdad caliphate all attempts
at control from that quarter came to an end. After the visit of
the Sultaft Bibars (1269) Mecca was governed by an amir dependent
on Egypt. Outside the two cities anarchy prevailed,
and the pilgrimage was frequently unsafe owing to marauding
Bedouins. In 1517 the Osm&#257;nl&#299; Turkish sultan Selim conquered
Egypt, and having received the right of succession to the caliphate
was solemnly presented by the sher&#299;f of Mecca with the keys of
the city, and recognized as the spiritual head of Islam and ruler
of the Hejaz. At the same time Yemen, which since the 9th
century had been in the power of a number of small dynasties
ruling in Zubed, San&#8219;&#257;, Sa&#8219;da and Aden, passed into the hands
of the Turk.</p>

<i>Omarah&rsquo;s History of Yaman</i> (London, 1892), and S. Lane-Poole,
<i>The Mahommedan Dynasties</i>, pp. 87-103 (Westminster, 1894).
Little more than a century later (1630), a Yemen noble Kh&#257;&#7779;im
succeeded in expelling the Turk and establishing a native im&#257;mate,
which lasted until 1871. For descriptions of it in the 18th century
cf. C. Niebuhr&rsquo;s accounts of his travels in Arabia in 1761.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Oman.</i>&mdash;Since the separation from the caliphate (before
1000 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>) Oman had remained independent. For more than
a century it was governed by five elected im&#257;ms, who were
chosen from the tribe of al-Azd and generally lived at Nizwa.
After them the Bani Nebh&#257;n gained the upper hand and established
a succession of kings (<i>m&#257;liks</i>) who governed from 1154
to 1406. During this time the country was twice invaded by
Persians. The &ldquo;kings of Horm&#363;z&rdquo; claimed authority over the
coast land until the beginning of the 16th century. In 1435
the people rose against the tyranny of the Bani Nebhan and
restored the imamate of the tribe al-Azd. In 1508 the Portuguese
under Albuquerque seized most of the east coast of Oman.
In 1624 a new dynasty arose in the interior, when N&#257;&#7779;ir ibn
Murshid of the Yariba (Ya&#8219;aruba) tribe (originally from Yemen)
was elected im&#257;m and established his capital at Rustak. He
was able to subdue the petty princes of the country, and the
Portuguese were compelled to give up several towns and pay
tribute for their residence at Muscat. About 1651 the Portuguese
were finally expelled from this city, and about 1698 from the
Omanite settlements on the east coast of Africa.</p>

<p><i>Wahh&#257;bi Movement.</i>&mdash;Modern Arabian history begins with
that of the Wahhabi movement in the middle of the 18th century.
Its originator, Mahommed Ibn Abdul Wahh&#257;b, was born (1691)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>
at Ayana in Nejd, and after studying in Basra and Damascus,
and making the pilgrimage to Mecca returned to his native
country and settled down at Huremala near Deraiya. The abuses
and corruptions which had overgrown the practice of orthodox
Islam had deeply impressed him, and he set to work to combat
them, and to inculcate on all good Moslems a return to the
pure simplicity of their original faith. In 1742 Mahommed
Ibn Saud, sheik of Deraiya, accepted his doctrines, and enforced
them by his sword with such effect that before his death in 1765
the whole of eastern Nejd and El Hasa was converted to the
faith of Abdul Wahhab, and accepted the political supremacy
of Ibn Sa&#363;d. His son and successor, Abdul Aziz, in a rapid
series of successful campaigns, extended his dominion and that
of the reformed faith far beyond the limits of Nejd. His attacks
on the pilgrim caravans, begun in 1783 and constantly repeated,
startled the Mahommedan world,<a name="fa2k" id="fa2k" href="#ft2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and compelled the attention
of the sultan, as the nominal protector of the faithful. In 1798
a Turkish force was sent from Bagdad into El Hasa, but was
compelled to retreat without accomplishing anything, and its
discomfiture added much to the renown of the Wahh&#257;bi power.
In 1801 Saud, son of the amir Abdul Aziz, led an expedition to
the Euphrates, and on the festival of Bairam, the 20th of April,
stormed Kerbela, put the defenders to the sword, destroyed the
sacred tomb, scattered the sacred relics and returned laden with
the treasures, accumulated during centuries in the sanctuary
of the Shi&#257; faith. Mecca itself was taken; plundering was forbidden,
but the tombs of the saints and all objects of veneration
were ruthlessly destroyed, and all ceremonies which seemed in
the eye of the stern puritan conqueror to suggest the taint of
idolatry were forbidden.</p>

<p>On the 14th of October 1802 the amir Abdul Aziz, at the age of
eighty-two years, was murdered by a Shi&#257; fanatic when at prayers
in the mosque of Deraiya, and Sa&#363;d, who had for many years
led the Wahh&#257;bi armies, became the reigning amir. In 1804
Medina was taken and with its fall all resistance ceased. The
Wahhabi empire had now attained its zenith, a settled government
was established able to enforce law and order in the desert
and in the towns, and a spirit of Arabian nationality had grown
up which bade fair to extend the Wahh&#257;bi dominion over all
the Arab race. It already, however, bore within it the germ of
decay; the accumulation of treasure in the capital had led to a
corruption of the simple manners of the earlier times; the
exhaustion of the tribes through the heavy blood tax had roused
discontent among them; the plundering of the holy places,
the attacks on the pilgrim caravans under the escort of Turkish
soldiers, and finally, in 1810, the desecration of the tomb of
Mahomet and the removal of its costly treasures, raised a cry
of dismay throughout the Mahommedan world, and made it
clear even to the Turkish sultan that unless the Wahh&#257;bi
power were crushed his claims to the caliphate were at an
end.</p>

<p>But Turkey was herself fully occupied by affairs in Europe,
and to Mehemet Ali, then pasha of Egypt, was deputed the task
of bringing the Wahh&#257;bis into subjection. In October 1811 an
expedition consisting of 10,000 men under Tusun Pasha, the
pasha&rsquo;s son, a youth of sixteen, landed in Hejaz without opposition.
Sa&#363;d with his main forces had started northwards to
attack Bagdad, but returning at once he met and defeated
Tusun with great loss and compelled him to retire. Medina
and subsequently Mecca were eventually taken by the Egyptians,
but in spite of continual reinforcements they could do little
more than hold their own in Hejaz. In 1813 Mehemet Ali was
compelled to take the field himself with fresh troops, but was
unable to achieve any decisive success, and in 1814 Tusun was
again defeated beyond Taif. In May 1814 Saud died, and his
son, &#256;bdallah, attempted to negotiate, but Mehemet Ali refused all
overtures, and in January 1815 advanced into Nejd, defeated the
Wahh&#257;bi army and occupied Ras, then the chief town in Kasim.
Terms of peace were made, but on the retirement of the Egyptians
&#256;bdallah refused to carry out the conditions agreed on, which
included the return of the jewels plundered by his father, and
another campaign had to be fought before his submission was
obtained. Ibrahim Pasha replaced Tusun in command, and on
reaching Arabia in September 1816 his first aim was to gain
over the great Bedouin tribes holding the roads between Hejaz
and his objective in Nejd; having thus secured his line of advance
he pushed on boldly and defeated Abdallah at Wiya, where he
put to death all prisoners taken; thence rapidly advancing,
with contingents of the friendly Harb and Muter tribes in
support of his regular troops, he laid siege to Ras; this place,
however, held out and after a four months&rsquo; siege he was compelled
to give up the attack. Leaving it on one side he pushed
on eastwards, took Aneza after six days&rsquo; bombardment and
occupied Bureda. Here he waited two months for reinforcements,
and with his Bedouin contingent, strengthened by the
adhesion of the &#256;teba and Bani Kh&#257;lid tribes, advanced on
Shakra in Wushm, which fell in January 1818 after a regular
siege. After destroying Huremala and massacring its inhabitants,
he arrived before Deraiya on the 14th of April 1818.
For six months the siege went on with varying fortune, but at
last the courage and determination of Ibrahim triumphed,
and on the 9th of September, after a heroic resistance, &#256;bdallah,
with a remnant of four hundred men, was compelled to surrender.
The Wahh&#257;bi leader was soon after sent to Constantinople,
where, in spite of Mehemet Ali&rsquo;s intercession, he and the companions
who had followed him in his captivity were condemned
to death, and after being paraded through the city with ignominy
for three days were finally beheaded.</p>

<p>Deraiya was razed to the ground and the principal towns of
Nejd were compelled to admit Egyptian garrisons; but though
the Arabs saw themselves powerless to stand before disciplined
troops, the Egyptians, on the other hand, had to confess that
without useless sacrifices they could not retain their hold on the
interior.</p>

<p>In 1824 Turki, son of the unfortunate &#256;bdallah, headed a
rising which resulted in the re-establishment of the Wahh&#257;bi
state with Riad as its new capital; and during the next ten years
he consolidated his power, paying tribute to and under the
nominal suzerainty of Egypt till his murder in 1834. His son,
Fesal, succeeded him, but in 1836 on his refusal to pay tribute
an Egyptian force was sent to depose him and he was taken
prisoner and sent to Cairo, while a rival claimant, Khalid, was
established as amir in Riad. Mehemet Ali and his son Ibrahim
Pasha were, however, now committed to their conflict with
Turkey for Syria and Asia Minor, and had no troops to spare
for the thankless task of holding the Arabian deserts; the
garrisons were gradually withdrawn, and in 1842 F&#275;sal, who
had escaped from his prison at Cairo reappeared and was everywhere
recognized as amir. The few remaining Egyptian troops
were ejected from Riad, and with them all semblance of Egyptian
or Turkish rule disappeared from central Arabia.</p>

<p>For a time it looked as if the supremacy of the Wahh&#257;bi
empire was to be renewed; El Hasa, Harik, Kasim and Asir
returned to their allegiance, but over Oman and Yemen F&#275;sal
never re-established his dominion, and the Bahrein sheiks
with British support kept their independence.</p>

<p>A rival state had, however, arisen, under &#256;bdallah Ibn Rashid
in Jebel Shammar. Driven into exile owing to a feud between
his family and the Ibn &#256;li, the leading family of the
Shammar, &#256;bdallah came to Riad in 1830, and was
<span class="sidenote">Ibn Rashid.</span>
favourably received by the amir Turki. In 1834 he
was with F&#275;sal on an expedition against El Hasa when news came
of the amir&rsquo;s murder by his cousin Mash&#257;rah. By &#256;bdallah&rsquo;s
advice the expedition was abandoned; F&#275;sal hastened back
with all his forces to Riad, and invested the citadel where
Masharah had taken refuge, but failed to gain possession of it,
until &#256;bdallah with two companions found his way into the
palace, killed Mash&#257;rah, and placed F&#275;sal on the throne of his
father. As a reward for his services &#256;bdallah was appointed
governor of Jebel Shammar, and had already established himself
in Hail when the Egyptian expedition of 1836 removed F&#275;sal
temporarily from Nejd. During the exile of the latter he steadily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>
consolidated his power, extending his influence more especially
over the desert tribes, till on F&#275;sal&rsquo;s return in 1842 he had
created a state subject only in name to that of which Riad was
the capital.</p>

<p>On the death of &#256;bdallah in 1843, his son Tal&#257;l succeeded.
He set himself to work to establish law and order throughout
the state, to arrange its finances, and to encourage the settlement
in Hail of artificers and merchants from abroad; the building
of the citadel and palace commenced by Mehemet Ali, and
continued by &#256;bdallah Ibn Rashid, was completed by Tal&#257;l. The
town walls were strengthened, new wells dug, gardens planted,
mosques and schools built. His uncle Obed, to whom equally
with &#256;bdallah is due the foundation of the Ibn Rashid dynasty,
laboured to extend the Shammar boundaries. Khaibar, Tema
and Jauf became tributary to Hail.</p>

<p>Though tolerant in religion Tal&#257;l was careful to avoid the
suspicion of lukewarmness towards the Wahh&#257;bi formulas.
Luxury in clothing and the use of tobacco were prohibited;
attendance at the mosque was enforced: any doubt as to his
orthodoxy was silenced by the amount and regularity of the
tribute sent by him to Riad. Equally guarded was his attitude
to the Turkish authorities; it is not improbable that Talal had
also entered into relations with the viceroy of Egypt to ensure
his position in case of a collision with the Porte. During his
twenty years&rsquo; reign Jebel Shammar became a model state, where
justice and security ruled in a manner before unheard of. F&#275;sal
may well have watched with jealous anxiety the growing strength
of his neighbour&rsquo;s state as compared with his own, where all
progress was arrested by the deadening tyranny of religious
fanaticism.</p>

<p>On the 11th of March 1868 Tal&#257;l, smitten with an incurable
malady, fell by his own hand and was succeeded by his brother
Mat&#257;b; after a brief reign he was murdered by his
nephews, the elder of whom, Bandar, became amir.
<span class="sidenote">The amir Mahommed.</span>
Mahommed, the third son of the amir &#256;bdallah, was at
the time absent; with a view of getting his uncle into
his power, Bandar invited him to return to Hail, and on his arrival
went out to meet him accompanied by Hamud, son of Obed, and
a small following. Warned by a hurried sign by Hamud that his
life was in danger, Mahommed at once attacked Bandar, stabbed
him and took possession of the citadel; a general massacre of
all members of the house of Ibn Rashid followed, and next day
Mahommed appeared with his cousin Hamud in the market-place
of Hail, and announced his assumption of the amirship. A
strong and capable ruler, he soon established his authority over
all northern and western Nejd, and in 1872 the opportunity
arrived for his intervention in the east. In that year Abdallah,
who had succeeded F&#275;sal in Riad in 1867, was deposed, but with
the assistance of Mahommed was reinstated; two years later,
however, he was again deposed and forced to seek refuge at Hail,
from which place he appealed for assistance to the Turkish
authorities at Bagdad. Midhat Pasha, then governor-general,
seized the occasion of asserting Turkish dominion on the Persian
Gulf coast, and in 1875, in spite of British protests, occupied
El Hasa and established a new province under the title of Nejd,
with its headquarters at Hofuf, of which &#256;bdallah was appointed
governor. This was an event of some importance, as it constituted
the first Turkish claim to the sovereignty over Nejd
abandoned by Egypt thirty-three years earlier. The Turks did
not support their client by advancing into Nejd itself, and he
and his rivals were left to fight out their battles among
themselves. Turkey was indeed too much occupied by the war
with Russia to pay much attention to Arab affairs, though
a few years later she attempted to occupy Bahrein by a
<i>coup de main</i>, which was only frustrated by the action of a
British gunboat.</p>

<p>Owing to the dissensions among the ruling family of Riad,
the towns of eastern Nejd gradually reverted to their former
condition of independence, but menaced in turn by the growing
power of Hail, they formed a coalition under the leadership of
Z&#257;mil, sheik of Aneza, and in the spring of 1891, Aneza, Bureda,
Shakra, Ras and Riad assembled their contingents to contest
with Ibn Rashid the supremacy in Nejd. The latter had besides
20,000 of his own south Shammar tribesmen, the whole strength
of the Harb Bedouins, some 10,000 men, and an additional
support of 1000 mounted men from his kinsmen, the northern
Shammar from the Euphrates, while the Muter and &#256;teba tribes
took part with the allies. The total strength of each side
amounted to about 30,000 men. Z&#257;mil&rsquo;s forces held a strong
position between Aneza and Bureda, and for over a month
desultory fighting went on; finally an attack was made against
the defenders&rsquo; centre, covered by 20,000 camel riders; the men
of Aneza broke and the whole allied forces fled in disorder; Zamil
and his eldest son were killed, as were also two of the Ibn Saud
family, while the remainder were taken prisoners. Aneza and
Bureda surrendered the same day, and shortly after Ras, Shakra
and Riad tendered their submission.</p>

<p>This victory placed the whole of northern and central Arabia
under the supremacy of Mahommed Ibn Rashid, which he held
undisputed during the rest of his life.</p>

<p>On his death in 1897 his nephew Abdul-Aziz, son of the
murdered amir Matab, succeeded; during his reign a new
element has been introduced into Nejd politics by the
rising importance of Kuwet (Koweit) and the attempts
<span class="sidenote">Recent history.</span>
of Turkey to obtain possession of its important harbour.
In 1901 a quarrel arose between Sheik Mub&#257;rak of Kuwet and
the amir of Hail whose cause was supported by Turkey. A force
was equipped at Basra under Ahmad Feizi Pasha with the
intention of occupying Kuwet; Mub&#257;rak thereupon appealed to
Great Britain and action was taken which prevented the Turkish
designs from being carried out. Kuwet was not formally placed
under British protection, but it was officially announced by the
government on the 5th of May 1903 &ldquo;that the establishment of a
naval base or fortified port in the Persian Gulf by any other
power would be regarded as a very grave menace to British
interests which would certainly be resisted with all the means at
its disposal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime Sheik Mub&#257;rak had found useful allies in
the Muntafik Arabs from the lower Euphrates, and the Wahh&#257;bis
of Riad; the latter under the amir Ibn Sa&#363;d marched against
Ibn Rashid, who at the instigation of the Porte had again
threatened Kuwet (Koweit), compelled him to retire to his own
territory and took possession of the towns of Bureda and Aneza.
Sheik Mub&#257;rak and his allies continued their advance, defeated
Ibn Rashid in two engagements on the 22nd of July and the 26th
of September 1904, and drove him back on his capital, Hail.
The Porte now made another effort to assist its protégé; two
columns were despatched from Medina and Basra respectively,
to relieve Hail, and drive out the Wahhabis. Ahmad Feizi Pasha,
in command of the Basra column, 4200 strong, crossed the
desert and reached the wells of Lina, 200 m. from Hail, on the
5th of March 1905; here, however, he received orders to halt and
negotiate before proceeding farther. The Turkish government
realized by this time the strength of the hostile combination,
and in view of the serious state of affairs in Yemen, hesitated to
undertake another campaign in the deserts of Nejd. Arrangements
were accordingly made with the Wahh&#257;bis, and on the
10th of April Ahmad Feizi Pasha left Lina, ostensibly with the
object of protecting the pilgrim road, and joined the Medina
column by the end of the month. Bureda and Aneza were
occupied without opposition, the rebellious sheiks amnestied by
the sultan and loaded with gifts, and formal peace was made
between the rival factions.</p>

<p>European influence was not felt in Arabia until the arrival
of the Portuguese in the eastern seas, following on the discovery
of the Cape route. In 1506 Hormuz was taken by
Albuquerque, and Muscat and the coast of Oman (<i>q.v.</i>)
<span class="sidenote">History of European influence.</span>
were occupied by the Portuguese till 1650. In 1516
their fleets appeared in the Red Sea and an unsuccessful
attempt was made against Jidda; but the effective occupation
of Yemen by the Turks in the next few years frustrated any
designs the Portuguese may have had in S.W. Arabia. Even in
Oman their hold on the country was limited to Muscat and the
adjacent ports, while the interior was ruled by the old Y&#257;riba
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>
(Ya-&#8219;aruba) dynasty from their capital at Rustak. The Persian
occupation, which followed that of the Portuguese, came to an
end in the middle of the 18th century, when Ahmad Ibn Said
expelled the invaders and in 1759 established the Ghafari
dynasty which still reigns in Oman. He was succeeded by his
son, who in 1798 made a treaty with the East India Company with
the object of excluding the French from Oman, and the connexion
<span class="sidenote">British intervention in Oman.</span>
with Great Britain was further strengthened during
the long reign of his grandson Sultan S&#257;id, 1804-1856.
During the earlier years of his reign he was constantly
at war with the Wahh&#257;bi empire, to which Oman
became for a time tributary. The piracies committed by the
Jawasimi Arabs in the gulf compelled the intervention of England,
and in 1810 their strongholds were destroyed by a British-Indian
expedition. The overthrow of the Wahhabis in 1817 restored
Sultan Said to independence; he equipped and armed on
Western models a fleet built in Indian ports, and took possession
of Sokotra and Zanzibar, as well as the Persian coast north of
the straits of Hormuz as far east as Gwadur, while by his liberal
policy at home Sohar, Barka and Muscat became prosperous
commercial ports.</p>

<p>On his death in 1856 the kingdom was divided, Maj&#299;d, a
younger son, taking Zanzibar, while the two elder sons contested
the succession to Oman. The eldest, Thuw&#275;ni, with British
support, finally obtained the throne, and in 1862 an engagement
was entered into by the French and English governments respecting
the independence of the sultans of Oman. He was
assassinated in 1866, and his successor, Seyyid Turki, reigned
till 1888. On his death several claimants disputed the succession;
ultimately his son F&#275;sal was recognized by the British government,
and was granted a subsidy from British-Indian revenues,
in consideration of which he engaged not to cede any of his
territory without the consent of the British government; similar
engagements have been entered into by the tribes who occupy
the south coast from the borders of Oman westward to the
straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.</p>

<p>The opening of the overland route to India again brought
the west coast of Arabia into importance. Aden was occupied
by the British in 1839. The Hejaz coast and some
of the Yemen ports were still held by Mehemet Ali,
<span class="sidenote">British sphere of influence.</span>
as viceroy of Egypt, but on his final withdrawal from
Arabia in 1845, Hejaz came under direct Turkish rule,
and the conquest of Yemen in 1872 placed the whole Red Sea
littoral (with the exception of the Midian coast, ceded by Egypt
on the accession of Abbas Hilmi Pasha) under Ottoman administration.
The island of Perim at the southern entrance of the Red Sea
has been a British possession since 1857, while the promontory
of Shekh Said on the Arabian side of the strait is in Turkish
occupation. In order to define the limits between Turkish
territory and that of the independent Arab tribes in political
relations with Great Britain, a joint commission of British and
Turkish officers in 1902-1905 laid down a boundary line from
Shekh Said to a point on the river Bana, 12 m. north-east of the
small town of Kataba, from which it is continued in a north-easterly
direction up to the great desert. This delimitation
places the whole of southern Arabia, east of this line, within the
British sphere of influence, which thus includes the district
surrounding Aden (<i>q.v.</i>), the Hadramut and Oman with its
dependencies.</p>

<p>The provinces of Hejaz and Yemen are each administered by
a Turkish governor-general, with headquarters at Taif and Sana
respectively; the country is nominally divided up
into divisions and districts under minor officials, but
<span class="sidenote">Turkish rule.</span>
Turkish rule has never been acquiesced in by the
inhabitants, and beyond the larger towns, all of which are held
by strong garrisons, Turkish authority hardly exists. The
powerful Bedouin tribes of Hejaz have always asserted their
independence, and are only kept quiet by the large money
payments made them by the sultan on the occasion of the
annual pilgrimage to the holy cities. A large part of Asir
and northern Yemen has never been visited by Turkish
troops, and such revenues as are collected, mainly from
vexatious customs and transit duties, are quite insufficient
to meet the salaries of the officials, while the troops, ill-fed
and their pay indefinitely in arrears, live on the country as
best they can.</p>

<p>A serious revolt broke out in Yemen in 1892. A Turkish
detachment collecting taxes in the Bani Merwan lands north
of Hodeda was destroyed by a body of Arabs. This
reverse set all Yemen aflame; under the leadership
<span class="sidenote">Yemen revolt.</span>
of the imam, who had, since the Turkish occupation,
lived in retirement at Sada, 120 m. north of the capital, the powerful
tribes between Asir and Sana advanced southwards, occupied
the principal towns and besieged the few Turkish fortified posts
that still held out. In many cases the garrisons, Arab troops
from Syria, went over to the insurgents. Meanwhile, reinforcements
under General Ahmad Feizi Pasha reached Hodeda,
Manakha was retaken, Sana relieved, and by the end of January
1893 the country with the exception of the northern mountainous
districts was reconquered.</p>

<p>A state of intermittent rebellion, however, continued, and in
1904 a general revolt took place with which the normal garrison
of Yemen, the 7th army corps, was quite unable to cope. The
military posts were everywhere besieged, and Sana, the capital,
was cut off from all communication with the coast. During
February 1905 reinforcements were sent up which raised the
garrison of Sana to a strength of eight battalions, and in March
a further reinforcement of about the same strength arrived,
and fought its way into the capital with the loss of almost all
its guns and train. The position was then desperate, wholesale
desertion and starvation had decimated the garrison, and three
weeks later Ali Riza Pasha, the Turkish commander, was compelled
to surrender. The fall of Sana made a deep impression
at Constantinople, every effort was made to hasten out reinforcements,
the veteran Ahmad Feizi Pasha was nominated to the
supreme command, and Anatolian troops in place of the unreliable
Syrian element were detailed. The scale of the operations
may be judged from the fact that the total number of troops
mobilized up to the beginning of July 1905 amounted to 126
battalions, 8 squadrons and 15 batteries; the rebel leader
Mahommed Yahiya had at this time a following of 50,000.</p>

<p>By the end of June, Ahmad Feizi Pasha was in a position to
advance on Manakha, where he organized an efficient transport,
rallied the scattered remnants of Ali Riza&rsquo;s army, and with the
newly arrived troops had by the middle of July a force of some
40 battalions available for the advance on Sana. He left
Manakha on the 17th of July, and after almost daily fighting
reached Sana on the 30th of August; on the 31st he entered
the city without serious opposition, the insurgents having
retreated northward.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Literature</p>

<p>The literature of Arabia has its origin in the songs, improvisations,
recitations and stories of the pre-Mahommedan Arabs.
Of written literature in those days there was, so far as we know,
none. But where books failed memory was strong and the
power of retaining things heard was not confined to a professional
class. At every festive meeting many could contribute a poem
or a story, many could even improvise the one or the other.
When members of different tribes met in peace (as at the fair
of &#8219;Uk&#257;&#7827;) the most skilful reciters strove to maintain the honour
of their own people, and a ready improviser was held in high
esteem. The smartest epigrams, the fairest similes, the keenest
satires, spoken or sung on such occasions, were treasured in the
memory of the hearers and carried by them to their homes.
But the experience of all peoples in that memory requires to be
helped by form. Sentences became balanced and were made
clear by some sort of definite ending. The simplest form of this
in Arabian literature is the <i>saj&#8219;</i> or rhymed prose, in which the
sentences are usually (though not always) short and end in a
rhyme or assonance. Mahomet used this form in many parts
of the Koran (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Sura</i>, 81). The next step was the introduction
of metre into the body of the sentence and the restriction of
the passages to a definite length. This in its simplest form gave
rise to the <i>rajaz</i> verses, where each half-line ends in the same
rhyme and consists of three feet of the measure <img style="width:50px; height:12px" src="images/img271.jpg" alt="" />. Other
metres were introduced later until sixteen altogether were recognized.
In all forms the rhyme is the same throughout the
poem, and is confined to the second half of the line except in the
first line where the two halves rhyme. While, however, these
measures were in early use, they were not systematically analysed
or their rules enunciated until the time of Khal&#299;l ibn Ahmad
in the 8th century. Two other features of Arabian poetry are
probably connected with the necessity for aiding the memory.
The first of these is the requirement that each line should have
a complete sense in itself; this produces a certain jerkiness,
and often led among the Arabs to displacement in the order
of the lines in a long poem. The other feature, peculiar to the
long poem (<i>qas&#299;da</i>, elegy), is that, whatever its real object,
whatever its metre, it has a regular scheme in the arrangement
of its material. It begins with a description of the old camping-ground,
before which the poet calls on his companion to stop,
while he bewails the traces of those who have left for other places.
Then he tells of his love and how he had suffered from it, how he
had journeyed through the desert (this part often contains some
of the most famous descriptions and praises of animals) until
his beast became thin and worn-out. Then at last comes the
real subject of the poem, usually the panegyric of some man of
influence or wealth to whom the poet has come in hope of reward
and before whom he recites the poem.</p>

<p><i>Poetry.</i>&mdash;The influence of the poet in pre-Mahommedan days
was very great. As his name, <i>ash-Sh&#257;&#8219;ir</i>, &ldquo;the knowing man,&rdquo;
indicates, he was supposed to have more than natural knowledge
and power. Panegyric and satire (<i>hij&#257;&#8219;</i>) were his chief instruments.
The praise of the tribe in well-chosen verses ennobled
it throughout the land, a biting satire was enough to destroy
its reputation (cf. I. Goldziher&rsquo;s <i>Abhandlungen zur arabischen
Philologie</i>, i. pp. 1-105). Before Mahomet the ethics of the
Arabs were summed up in <i>muruwwa</i> (custom). Hospitality,
generosity, personal bravery were the subjects of praise; meanness
and cowardice those of satire. The existence of poetry
among the northern Arabs was known to the Greeks even in the
4th century (cf. St Nilos in Migne&rsquo;s <i>Patrologia Graeca</i>, vol. 79,
col. 648, and Sozomen&rsquo;s <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, bk. 6, ch. 38).
Women as well as men composed and recited poems before the
days of the Prophet (cf. L. Cheikho&rsquo;s <i>Poetesses of the J&#257;hiliyya</i>,
in Arabic, Beirut, 1897).</p>

<p>The transmission of early Arabic poetry has been very imperfect.
Many of the reciters were slain in battle, and it was
not till the 8th to the 10th centuries and even later that the
earliest collections of these poems were made. Many have to
be recovered from grammars, dictionaries, &amp;c., where single
lines or groups of lines are quoted to illustrate the proper use
of words, phrases or idioms. Moreover, many a reciter was not
content to declaim the genuine verses of ancient poets, but
interpolated some of his own composition, and the change of
religion introduced by Islam led to the mutilation of many
verses to suit the doctrines of the new creed.<a name="fa3k" id="fa3k" href="#ft3k"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>The language of the poems, as of all the best Arabian literature,
was that of the desert Arabs of central Arabia; and to use it
aright was the ambition of poets and scholars even in the Abbasid
period. For the man of the towns its vocabulary was too copious
to be easily understood, and in the age of linguistic studies
many commentaries were written to explain words and idioms.</p>

<p>Of the pre-Mahommedan poets the most famous were the six
whose poems were collected by Asma&#8219;&#299; about the beginning of
the 9th century (ed. W. Ahlwardt, <i>The Diwans of the Six Ancient
Arabic Poets</i>, London, 1870). Single poems of four of
these&mdash;Amru-ul-Qais, &#7788;arafa, Zuhair and &#8219;Antara&mdash;appear in the
Mo&rsquo;allakat (<i>q.v.</i>). The other two were N&#257;bigha (<i>q.v.</i>) and
&#8219;Alqama (<i>q.v.</i>). But besides these there were many others whose
names were famous; such as Ta&#8219;abbata Sharran, a popular
hero who recites his own adventures with great gusto; his
companion Shanfar&#257;, whose fame rests on a fine poem which has
been translated into French by de Sacy (in his <i>Chrestomathie
Arabe</i>) and into English by G. Hughes (London, 1896); Aus ibn
Hajar of the Bani Tamin, famous for his descriptions of weapons
and hunting scenes (ed. R. Geyer, Vienna, 1892); &#7716;&#257;tim T&#257;&rsquo;i,
renowned for his open-handed generosity as well as for his poetry
(ed. F. Schulthess, Leipzig, 1897, with German translation);
and &#8219;Urwa ibn ul-Ward of the tribe of &#8219;Abs, rival of &#7716;&#257;tim in
generosity as well as in poetry (ed. Th. Nöldeke, Göttingen,
1863). Among these early poets are found one Jew of repute,
Samau&rsquo;al (Samuel) ibn Adiy&#257; (cf. Th. Nöldeke&rsquo;s <i>Beiträge</i>,
pp. 52-86; art. <i>s.v.</i> &ldquo;Samuel ibn Adiya&rdquo; in <i>Jewish Encyc.</i> and
authorities there quoted), and some Christians such as &#8219;Ad&#299;&#8219;ibn
Zaid of Hira, who sang alike of the pleasures of drink and of
death (ed. by Louis Cheikho in his <i>Les Poètes arabes chrétiens</i>,
pp. 439-474, Beirut, 1890; in this work many Arabian poets
are considered to be Christian without sufficient reason). One
poet, a younger contemporary of Mahomet, has attracted much
attention because his poems were religious and he was a monotheist.
This is Umayya ibn Abi-&#7779;-&#7778;alt, a Meccan who did not
accept Islam and died in 630. His poems are discussed by
F. Schulthess in the <i>Orientalische Studien</i> dedicated by Th.
Nöldeke, Giessen, 1906, and his relation to Mahomet by E. Power
(in the <i>Mélanges de la faculté orientale de l&rsquo;université Saint-Joseph</i>,
Beirut, 1906). Mahomet&rsquo;s relation to the poets generally was
one of antagonism because of their influence over the Arabs
and their devotion to the old religion and customs. Ka&#8219;b ibn
Zuhair, however, first condemned to death, then pardoned, later
won great favour for himself by writing a panegyric of the
Prophet (ed. G. Freytag, Halle, 1823). Another poet, A&#8219;sha
(<i>q.v.</i>), followed his example. Lab&#299;d (<i>q.v.</i>) and Hass&#257;n ibn Th&#257;bit
(<i>q.v.</i>) were also contemporary. Among the poetesses of the time
Khansa (<i>q.v.</i>) is supreme. In the scarcity of poets at this time
two others deserve mention; Ab&#363; Mihjan, who made peace
with Islam in 630 but was exiled for his love of wine, which he
celebrated in his verse (ed. L. Abel, Leiden, 1887; cf. C. Landberg&rsquo;s
<i>Primeurs arabes</i>, 1, Leiden, 1886), and Jarwal ibn Aus,
known as al-&#7716;u&#7789;ai&#8219;a, a wandering poet whose keen satires led
to his imprisonment by Omar (Poems, ed. by I. Goldziher in the
<i>Journal of the German Oriental Society</i>, vols. 46 and 47).</p>

<p>Had the simplicity and religious severity of the first four
caliphs continued in their successors, the fate of poetry would
have been hard. Probably little but religious poetry would have
been allowed. But the Omayyads (with one exception) were not
religious men and, while preserving the outward forms of Islam,
allowed full liberty to the pre-Islamic customs of the Arabs and
the beliefs and practices of Christians. At the same time the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
circumstances of the poet&rsquo;s life were altered. Poetry depended
on patronage, and that was to be had now chiefly in the court of
the caliph and the residences of his governors. Hence the centre
of attraction was now the city with its interests, not the desert.
Yet the old forms of poetry were kept. The <i>qas&#299;da</i> still required
the long introduction (see above), which was entirely occupied
with the affairs of the desert. Thus poetry became more and
more artificial, until in the Abbasid period poets arose who felt
themselves strong enough to give up the worn-out forms and
adopt others more suitable. The names of three great poets
adorn the Omayyad period: Akhtal, Farazdaq and Jar&#299;r were
contemporaries (see separate articles). The first was a Christian
of the tribe of Taghlib, whose Christianity enabled him to write
many verses which would have been impossible to a professing
Moslem. Protected by the caliph he employed the old weapons
of satire to support them against the &ldquo;Helpers&rdquo; and to exalt
his own tribe against the Qaisites. Farazdaq of the Bani Tam&#299;m,
a good Moslem but loose in morals, lived chiefly in Medina and
Kufa, and was renowned for his command of language. Jar&#299;r of
another branch of the Bani Tam&#299;m lived in Irak and courted the
favour of Hajj&#257;j, its governor. His satires were so effective that
he is said to have crushed forty-three rivals. His great efforts
were against Farazdaq, who was supported by Akhtal (cf. <i>The
Naka&rsquo;id of Jar&#299;r and al-Farazdaq</i>, ed. A.A. Bevan, Leiden, 1906
foll.). Among many minor poets one woman is conspicuous.
Laila ul-Akhyal&#299;yya (d. 706) was married to a stranger. On the
death of her lover in battle, she wrote numerous elegies bewailing
him, and so became famous and devoted the rest of her life to the
writing of verse. Two poets of the Koreish attained celebrity in
Arabia itself at this time. Qais ur-Ruqayy&#257;t was the poet of
&#8219;Abdallah ibn uz-Zubair (Abdallah ibn Zobair) and helped him
until circumstances went against him, when he made his peace
with the caliph. His poems are chiefly panegyrics and love songs
(ed. N. Rhodonakis, Vienna, 1902). &#8219;Umar ibn Ab&#299; Rab&#299;&#8219;a
(<i>c.</i> 643-719) was a wealthy man, who lived a life of ease in his
native town of Mecca, and devoted himself to intrigues and
writing love songs (ed. P. Schwarz, Leipzig, 1901-1902). His
poems were very popular throughout Arabia. As a dweller in
the town he was independent of the old forms of poetry, which
controlled all others, but his influence among poets was not great
enough to perpetuate the new style. One other short-lived
movement of the Omayyad period should be mentioned. The
<i>rajaz</i> poems (see above) had been a subordinate class generally
used for improvisations in pre-Mahommedan times. In the 7th
and 8th centuries, however, a group of poets employed them
more seriously. The most celebrated of these were &#8219;Ajj&#257;j and
his son Ru&rsquo;ba of the Bani Tam&#299;m (editions by W. Ahlwardt,
Berlin, 1903; German trans. of Ru&rsquo;ba&rsquo;s poems by Ahlwardt,
Berlin, 1904).</p>

<p>With the establishment of the Abbasid dynasty, a new epoch
in Arabian poetry began. The stereotyped beginning of the
<i>qas&#299;da</i> had been recognized as antiquated and out of place in
city life even in the Omayyad period (cf. Goldziher, <i>Abhandlungen</i>,
i. 144 ff). This form had been ridiculed but now it lost
its hold altogether, and was only employed occasionally by way
of direct imitation of the antique. The rise of Persian influence
made itself felt in much the same way as the Norman influence
in England by bringing a newer refinement into poetry. Tribal
feuds are no longer the main incentives to verse. Individual
experiences of life and matters of human interest become more
usual subjects. Cynicism, often followed by religion in a poet&rsquo;s
later life, is common. The tumultuous mixture of interests and
passions to be found in a city like Bagdad are the subjects of a
poet&rsquo;s verse. One of the earliest of these poets, Muti&#8219; ibn Ay&#257;s,
shows the new depth of personal feeling and refinement of
expression. Bashsh&#257;r ibn Burd (d. 783), a blind poet of Persian
descent, shows the ascendancy of Persian influence as he openly
rails at the Arabs and makes clear his own leaning to the Persian
religion. In the 8th century Abu Nuw&#257;s (<i>q.v.</i>) is the greatest
poet of his time. His language has the purity of the desert, his
morals are those of the city, his universalism is that of the man of
the world. Ab&#363;-l-&#8219;At&#257;hiya (<i>q.v.</i>), his contemporary, is fluent,
simple and often didactic. Muslim ibn ul-Wal&#299;d (ed. de Goeje,
Leiden, 1875), also contemporary, is more conservative of old
forms and given to panegyric and satire. In the 9th century two
of the best-known poets&mdash;Ab&#363; Tamm&#257;m (<i>q.v.</i>) and Bu&#7717;tur&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>)
&mdash;were renowned for their knowledge of old poetry (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hamasa</a></span>)
and were influenced by it in their own verse. On the other hand
Ibn ul-Mo&#8219;tazz (son of the caliph) was the writer of brilliant
occasional verse, free of all imitation. In the 10th century the
centre of interest is in the court of Saif ud-Daula (addaula) at
Aleppo. Here in Motanabb&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>) the claims of modern poetry
not only to equal but to excel the ancient were put forward and
in part at any rate recognized. Ab&#363; Fir&#257;s (932-968) was a
member of the family of Saif ud-Daula, a soldier whose poems
have all the charm that comes from the fact that the writer has
lived through the events he narrates (ed. by R. Dvo&#345;ák, Leiden,
1895). Many Arabian writers count Motanabbi the last of the
great poets. Yet Ab&#363;-l-&#8219;Al&#257; ul-Ma&#8219;arr&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>) was original alike
in his use of rhymes and in the philosophical nature of his poems.
Ibn Far&#299;d (<i>q.v.</i>) is the greatest of the mystic poets, and Bus&#299;ri
(<i>q.v.</i>) wrote the most famous poem extant in praise of the Prophet.
In the provinces of the caliphate there were many poets, who,
however, seldom produced original work. Spain, however, produced
Ibn &#8219;Abd&#363;n (d. 1126), famous for the grace and finish of
his style (ed. with commentary of Ibn Badrun by R.P.A. Dozy,
Leiden, 1846). The Sicilian Ibn Hamd&#299;s (1048-1132) spent the
last fifty years of his life in Spain (<i>Diw&#257;n</i>, ed. Moaçada, Palermo,
1883; <i>Canzoniere</i>, ed. Schiaparelli, Rome, 1897). It was also
apparently in this country that the strophe form was first used
in Arabic poems (cf. M. Hartmann&rsquo;s <i>Das arabische Strophengedicht</i>,
Weimar, 1897), and Ibn Quzm&#257;n (12th century), a
wandering singer, here first used the language of everyday life
in the form of verse known as <i>Zajal</i>.</p>

<p><i>Anthologies.</i>&mdash;As supplemental to the account of poetry may
be mentioned here some of the chief collections of ancient verse,
sometimes made for the sake of the poems themselves, sometimes
to give a <i>locus classicus</i> for usages of grammar or lexicography,
sometimes to illustrate ancient manners and customs. The
earliest of these is the <i>Mo&#8219;allakat</i> (<i>q.v.</i>). In the 8th century Ibn
Mofaddal compiled the collection named after him the <i>Mofaddal&#299;y&#257;t</i>.
From the 9th century we have the Hamasas of Ab&#363;
Tamm&#257;m and Buhtur&#299;, and a collection of poems of the tribe
Hudhail (second half ed. in part by J.G.L. Kosegarten, London,
1854; completed by J. Wellhausen in <i>Skizzen und Vorarbeiten</i>, i.
Berlin, 1884). The numerous quotations of Ibn Qutaiba (<i>q.v.</i>) in
the &#8219;Uy&#363;n ul-Akhb&#257;r (ed. C. Brockelmann, Strassburg, 1900 ff.)
and the <i>Book of Poetry and Poets</i> (ed. M.J. de Goeje, Leiden,
1904) bring these works into this class. In the 10th century
were compiled the <i>Jamharat ash&#8219;ar al Arab</i>, containing forty-nine
poems (ed. B&#363;l&#257;q, 1890), the work <i>al-&#8219;Iqd ul-Far&#299;d</i> of Ibn&#8219; Abdi-r-Rabbihi
(ed. Cairo, various years), and the greatest work of all
this class, the <i>K&#299;t&#257;b ul-Agh&#257;ni</i> (&ldquo;Book of Songs&rdquo;) (cf. <span class="sc">Abu-l
Faraj</span>). The 12th century contributes the <i>Diw&#257;n Mukhtar&#257;t
ush-Shu&#8219;ar&#257;&rsquo;i</i> with fifty qas&#299;das. The <i>Khiz&#257;nai ul-Adab</i> of
Abdulq&#257;dir, written in the 17th century in the form of a commentary
on verses cited in a grammar, contains much old verse
(ed. 4 vols., B&#363;l&#257;q, 1882).</p>

<p><i>Belles-Lettres and Romances.</i>&mdash;Mahomet in the Koran had made
extensive use of <i>saj&rsquo;</i> or rhymed prose (see above). This form
then dropped out of use almost entirely for some time. In the
10th century, however, it was revived, occurring almost simultaneously
in the <i>Sermons</i> of Ibn Nub&#257;ta (946-984) and the
<i>Letters</i> of Ab&#363; Bakr ul-Khw&#257;rizm&#299;. Both have been published
several times in the East. The epistolary style was further
cultivated by Hamadh&#257;ni (<i>q.v.</i>) and carried to perfection by
Ab&#363;-l&#8219;Al&#257; ul-Ma&#8219;arr&#299;. Hamadh&#299;ni was also the first to write
in this rhymed prose a new form of work, the <i>Maq&#257;ma</i>
(&ldquo;assembly&rdquo;). The name arose from the fact that scholars
were accustomed to assemble for the purpose of rivalling one
another in orations showing their knowledge of Arabic language,
proverb and verse. In the <i>Maq&#257;mas</i> of Hamadh&#257;ni a narrator
describes how in various places he met a wandering scholar who
in these assemblies puts all his rivals to shame by his eloquence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span>
Each oration forms the substance of a <i>Maq&#257;ma</i>, while the <i>Maq&#257;mas</i>
themselves are united to one another by the constant meetings
of narrator and scholar. Har&#299;r&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>) quite eclipsed the fame
of his predecessor in this department, and his <i>Maq&#257;mas</i> retain
their influence over Arabian literature to the present day. As
late as the 19th century the sheik N&#257;&#7779;&#299;f ul Y&#257;z&#299;j&#299; (1800-1871)
distinguished himself by writing sixty clever <i>Maq&#257;mas</i> in the
style of Hariri (ed. Beirut, 1856, 1872). While this class of
literature had devoted itself chiefly to the finesses of the language,
another set of works was given to meeting the requirements
of moral education and the training of a gentleman. This,
which is known as &ldquo;Adab literature,&rdquo; is anecdotic in style with
much quotation of early poetry and proverb. Thus government,
war, friendship, morality, piety, eloquence, are some of the titles
under which Ibn Qutaiba groups his stories and verses in the
<i>&#8219;Uy&#363;n ul Akhb&#257;r</i>. <i>J&#257;hiz</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) in the 9th century and Baihaq&#299;
(<i>The Kit&#257;b al-Ma&#7717;&#257;sin val-Mas&#257;wi</i>, ed. F. Schwally, Giessen,
1900-1902) early in the 10th, wrote works of this class. A little
later a Spaniard, Ibn &#8219;Abdrabbihi (Abdi-r-Rabbihi), wrote his
<i>&#8219;Iqd ul-Far&#299;d</i> (see section <i>Anthologies</i>). The growth of city
life in the Abbasid capital led to the desire for a new form
of story, differing from the old tales of desert life. This was met
in the first place by borrowing. In the 8th century Ibn Muqaffa&#8219;,
a convert from Mazdaism to Islam, translated the Pahlavi
version of Bidpai&rsquo;s fables (itself a version of the Indian
<i>Panchatantra</i>) into Arabic with the title <i>Kal&#299;la wa Dimna</i> (ed. Beir&#363;t,
various years). Owing to the purity of its language and style
it has remained a classic work. The <i>Book of the 1001 Nights</i>
(<i>Arabian Nights</i>) also has its basis in translations from the Indian
through the Persian, made as early as the 9th century. To these
stories have been added others originating in Bagdad and Egypt
and a few others, which were at first in independent circulation.
The whole work seems to have taken its present form (with local
variations) about the 13th century. Several other romances of
considerable length are extant, such as the <i>Story of &#8219;Antar</i>
(ed. 32 vols., Cairo, 1869, &amp;c., translated in part by Terrick
Hamilton, 4 vols., London, 1820), and the <i>Story of Saif ibn Dh&#299;
Yezen</i> (ed. Cairo, 1892).</p>
<div class="author">(G. W. T.)</div>

<p><i>Historical Literature.</i>&mdash;Arabian historians differ from all
others in the unique form of their compositions. Each event is
related in the words of eye-witnesses or contemporaries transmitted
to the final narrator through a chain of intermediate
reporters (<i>r&#257;w&#299;s</i>), each of whom passed on the original report
to his successor. Often the same account is given in two or
more slightly divergent forms, which have come down through
different chains of reporters. Often, too, one event or one important
detail is told in several ways on the basis of several contemporary
statements transmitted to the final narrator through
distinct lines of tradition. The writer, therefore, exercises no independent
criticism except as regards the choice of authorities; for
he rejects accounts of which the first author or one of the intermediate
links seems to him unworthy of credit, and sometimes
he states which of several accounts seems to him the best.</p>

<p>A second type of Arabian historiography is that in which an
author combines the different traditions about one occurrence
into one continuous narrative, but prefixes a statement as to
the lines of authorities used and states which of them he mainly
follows. In this case the writer recurs to the first method,
already described, only when the different traditions are greatly
at variance with one another. In yet a third type of history
the old method is entirely forsaken and we have a continuous
narrative only occasionally interrupted by citation of the
authority for some particular point. But the principle still is
that what has been well said once need not be told again in other
words. The writer, therefore, keeps as close as he can to the letter
of his sources, so that quite a late writer often reproduces the
very words of the first narrator.</p>

<p>From very early times story-tellers and singers found their
subjects in the doughty deeds of the tribe on its forays, and
sometimes in contests with foreign powers and in the impression
produced by the wealth and might of the sovereigns of Persia
and Constantinople. The appearance of the Prophet with the
great changes that ensued, the conquests that made the Arabs
lords of half the civilized world, supplied a vast store of new
matter for relations which men were never weary of hearing
and recounting. They wished to know everything about the
apostle of God. Every one who had known or seen him was
questioned and was eager to answer. Moreover, the word of
God in the Koran left many practical points undecided, and
therefore it was of the highest importance to know exactly how
the Prophet had spoken and acted in various circumstances.
Where could this be better learned than at Medina, where he had
lived so long and where the majority of his companions continued
to live? So at Medina a school was gradually formed, where the
chief part of the traditions about Mahomet and his first successors
took a form more or less fixed. Soon men began to assist memory
by making notes, and pupils sought to take written jottings
of what they had heard from their teachers. Thus by the close
of the 1st century many <i>dictata</i> were already in circulation.
For example, &#7716;asan of Ba&#7779;ra (d. 728 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>) had a great mass
of such notes, and he was accused of sometimes passing off as
oral tradition things he had really drawn from books; for oral
tradition was still the one recognized authority, and it is related
of more than one old scholar, and even of Hasan of Basra himself,
that he directed his books to be burned at his death. The books
were mere helps. Long after this date, when all scholars drew
mainly from books, the old forms were still kept up. &#7788;abar&#299;,
for example, when he cites a book expresses himself as if he had
heard what he quotes from the master with whom he read the
passage or from whose copy he transcribed it. He even expresses
himself in this wise: &ldquo;&#8219;Omar b. Shabba has <i>related</i> to
me in his book on the history of Ba&#7779;ra.&rdquo; No independent book
of the 1st century from the Flight (<i>i.e.</i> 622-719) has come down
to us. It is told, however, that Moawiya summoned an old
man named &#8219;Abid ibn Sharya from Yemen to Damascus to
tell him all he knew about ancient history and that he induced
him to write down his information. This very likely formed
the nucleus of a book which bore the name of that sheik and
was much read in the 3rd century from the Flight. It seems to be
lost now. But in the 2nd century (719-816) real books began to
be composed. The materials were supplied in the first place by
oral tradition, in the second by the <i>dictata</i> of older scholars,
and finally by various kinds of documents, such as treaties,
letters, collections of poetry and genealogical lists. Genealogical
studies had become necessary through Omar&rsquo;s system of assigning
state pensions to certain classes of persons according to their
kinship with the Prophet, or their deserts during his lifetime.
This subject received much attention even in the 1st century,
but books about it were first written in the 2nd, the most famous
being those of Ibn al-Kalb&#299; (d. 763), of his son Hish&#257;m (d. 819),
and of Al-Sharq&#299; ibn al-Qu&#7789;&#257;m&#299;. Genealogy, which often called
for elucidations, led on to history. Baladhuri&rsquo;s excellent <i>Ans&#257;b
al-Ashr&#257;f</i> (Genealogies of the Nobles) is a history of the Arabs
on a genealogical plan.</p>

<p>The oldest extant history is the biography of the Prophet
by Ibn Is&#7717;&#257;q (d. 767). This work is generally trustworthy.
Mahomet&rsquo;s life before he appeared as a prophet and the story
of his ancestors are indeed mixed with many fables illustrated
by spurious verses. But in Ibn Is&#7717;&#257;q&rsquo;s day these fables were
generally accepted as history&mdash;for many of them had been first
related by contemporaries of Mahomet&mdash;and no one certainly
thought it blameworthy to put pious verses in the mouth of the
Prophet&rsquo;s forefathers, though, according to the <i>Fihrist</i> (p. 92),
Ibn Is&#7717;&#257;q was duped by others with regard to the poems he
quotes. The original work of Ibn Is&#7717;&#257;q seems to be lost. That
which we possess is an edition of it by Ibn Hish&#257;m (d. 834) with
additions and omissions (text ed. by F. Wüstenfeld, Göttingen,
1858-1860; German translation by Weil, Stuttgart, 1864).</p>

<p>The <i>Life</i> of the Prophet by Ibn Oqba (d. 758), based on the
statements of two very trustworthy men, &#8219;Urwa ibn az-Zubair
(d. 713) and Az-zuhri (d. 742), was still much read in Syria in
the 14th century. Fragments of this have been edited by
E. Sachau, Berlin, 1904. We fortunately possess the <i>Book of
the Campaigns</i> of the Prophet by al-W&#257;qid&#299; (d. 822) and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span>
important <i>Book of Classes</i> of his disciple Ibn Sa&#8219;d (<i>q.v.</i>). W&#257;qid&#299;
had much more copious materials than Ibn Is&#7717;&#257;q, but gives
way much more to a popular and sometimes romancing style
of treatment. Nevertheless he sometimes helps us to recognize
in Ibn Is&#7717;&#257;q&rsquo;s narrative modifications of the genuine tradition
made for a purpose, and the additional details he supplies set
various events before us in a clearer light. Apart from this his
chief merits lie in his studies on the subject of the traditional
authorities, the results of which are given by Ibn Sa&#8219;d, and in
his chronology, which is often excellent. A special study of the
traditions about the conquest of Syria made by M.J. de Goeje
in 1864 (<i>Mémoires sur la conquête de la Syrie</i>, 2nd ed., Leiden,
1900), led to the conclusion that Waqidi&rsquo;s chronology is sound
as regards the main events, and that later historians have gone
astray by forsaking his guidance. This result has been confirmed
by certain contemporary notices found by Th. Nöldeke in 1874
in a Syriac MS. of the British Museum. And that Ibn Is&#7717;&#257;q
agrees with W&#257;qid&#299; in certain main dates is important evidence
for the trustworthiness of the former also. For the chronology
before the year 10 of the Flight W&#257;qid&#299; did his best, but here,
the material being defective, many of his conclusions are precarious.
W&#257;qid&#299; had already a great library at his disposal.
He is said to have had 600 chests of books, chiefly <i>dictata</i> written
by or for himself, but in part real books by Ab&#363; Mikhnaf (d. 748),
Ibn Is&#7717;&#257;q (whom he uses but does not name), &#8219;Aw&#257;na (d. 764),
Ab&#363; Mashar (d. 791) and other authors. Ab&#363; Mikhnaf left a
great number of monographs on the chief events from the death
of the Prophet to the caliphate of Walid II. These were much
used by later writers, and we have many extracts from them,
but none of the works themselves except a sort of romance based
on his account of the death of Hosain (&#7716;usain) of which Wüstenfeld
has given a translation. With regard to the history of Irak
in particular he was deemed to have the best information, and
for this subject he is Tabari&rsquo;s chief source, just as Mad&#257;in&#299;, a
younger contemporary of W&#257;qid&#299;, is followed by preference in
all that relates to Khorasan. Mad&#257;in&#299;&rsquo;s <i>History of the Caliphs</i>
is the best, if not the oldest, published before &#7788;abar&#299;; but this
book is known only by the excerpts given by later writers,
particularly Bal&#257;dhuri and &#7788;abar&#299;. From these we judge that
he had great narrative power, with much clear and exact learning,
and must be placed high as a critical historian. His plan was
to record the various traditions about an event, choosing them
with critical skill; sometimes, however, he fused the several
traditions into a continuous narrative. A just estimate of the
relative value of the historians can only be reached by careful
comparison in detail. This has been essayed by Brünnow in
his study on the Kh&#257;rijites (Leiden, 1884), in which the narrative
of Mubarrad in the K&#257;mil is compared with the excerpts of
Madaini given by Bal&#257;dhuri and those of Ab&#363; Mikhnaf given by
&#7788;abar&#299;. The conclusion reached is that Ab&#363; Mikhnaf and
M&#257;dain&#299; are both well informed and impartial.</p>

<p>Among the contemporaries of W&#257;qid&#299; and M&#257;dain&#299; were
Ibn Khid&#257;sh (d. 838), the historian of the family Muhallab,
whose work was one of Mubarrad&rsquo;s sources for the <i>History of
the Kh&#257;rijites</i>; Haitham ibn &#8219;Adi (d. 822), whose works, though
now lost, are often cited; and Saif ibn &#8219;Omar at-Tam&#299;m&#299;, whose
book on the revolt of the tribes under Abu-Bekr and on the
Mahommedan conquests was much used by &#7788;abar&#299;. His
narratives are detailed and often tinged with romance, and he
is certainly much inferior to W&#257;qid&#299; in accuracy. Wellhausen
has thoroughly examined the work of Saif in <i>Skizzen und
Vorarbeiten</i>, vi. Besides these are to be mentioned Ab&#363; &#8219;Ubaida
(d. 825), who was celebrated as a philologist and wrote several
historical monographs that are often cited, and Azraq&#299;, whose
excellent <i>History of Mecca</i> was published after his death by his
grandson (d. 858). With these writers we pass into the 3rd
century of Islam. But we have still an important point to notice
in the 2nd century; for in it learned Persians began to take part
in the creation of Arabic historical literature. Ibn Muqaffa&#8219;
translated the great <i>Book of Persian Kings</i>, and others followed
his example. &#7788;abar&#299; and his contemporaries, senior and junior,
such as Ibn Qutaiba, Ya&#8219;q&#363;b&#299;, D&#299;nawar&#299;, preserve to us a good
part of the information about Persian history made known
through such translations.<a name="fa4k" id="fa4k" href="#ft4k"><span class="sp">4</span></a> But even more important than the
knowledge conveyed by these works was their influence on
literary style and composition. Half a century later began
versions from the Greek either direct or through the Syriac.
The pieces translated were mostly philosophical; but the Arabs
also learned something, however superficially, of ancient history.</p>

<p>The 3rd century (816-913) was far more productive than the
2nd. Ab&#363; &#8219;Ubaida was succeeded by Ibn al-A&#8219;r&#257;b&#299; (d. 846), who
in like manner was chiefly famous as a philologist, and who wrote
about ancient poems and battles. Much that he wrote is quoted
in Tabr&#299;z&#299;&rsquo;s commentary on the <i>&#7716;am&#257;sa</i>, which is still richer in
extracts from the historical elucidations of early poems given
by ar-Riy&#257;sh&#299; (d. 871). Of special fame as a genealogist was
Ibn &#7716;ab&#299;b (d. 859), of whom we have a booklet on Arabian tribal
names (ed. Wüstenfeld, 1850). Azraqi again was followed by
F&#257;kih&#299;, who wrote a <i>History of Mecca</i> in 885,<a name="fa5k" id="fa5k" href="#ft5k"><span class="sp">5</span></a> and &#8219;Omar b.
Shabba (d. 876), who composed an excellent history of Ba&#7779;ra,
known to us only by excerpts. Of the works of Zubair b. Bakk&#257;r
(d. 870), one of &#7788;abar&#299;&rsquo;s teachers, a learned historian and genealogist
much consulted by later writers, there is a fragment in the
Köprülü library at Constantinople, and another in Göttingen,
part of which has been made known by Wüstenfeld (<i>Die Familie
Al-Zobair</i>, Göttingen, 1878). Ya&#8219;q&#363;b&#299; (Ibn W&#257;&#7693;i&#7717;) wrote a
short general history of much value (published by Houtsma,
Leiden, 1883). About India he knows more than his predecessors
and more than his successors down to Ber&#363;n&#299;. Ibn
Khord&#257;dhbeh&rsquo;s historical works are lost. Ibn &#8219;Abdal&#7717;akam
(d. 871) wrote of the conquest of Egypt and the West. Extracts
from this book are given by M&#8219;G. de Slane in his <i>Histoire des
Berbères</i>, from which we gather that it was a medley of true
tradition and romance, and must be reckoned, with the book
of his slightly senior contemporary, the Spaniard Ibn &#7716;&#257;b&#299;b,
in the class of historical romances. A high place must be
assigned to the historian Ibn Qutaiba or Kotaiba (d. 889),
who wrote a very useful <i>Handbook of History</i> (ed. Wüstenfeld,
Göttingen, 1850). Much more eminent is Bal&#257;dhur&#299; (d. 893),
whose book on the Arab conquest (ed. M.J. de Goeje, Leiden,
1865-1866) merits the special praise given to it by Mas&#8219;&#363;d&#299;,
and who also wrote a large work, the <i>Ans&#257;b al-Ashr&#257;f</i>. A
contemporary, Ibn abi T&#257;hir Taif&#363;r (d. 894), wrote on the
Abbasid caliphs and was drawn on by &#7788;abar&#299;. The sixth part
of his work is in the British Museum. The universal history
of Dinawari (d. 896), entitled <i>The Long Narratives</i>, has been
edited by Girgas (1887).</p>

<p>All these histories are more or less thrown into the shade by
the great work of &#7788;abar&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>), whose fame has never faded from
his own day to ours. The <i>Annals</i> (ed. M. de Goeje, Leiden,
1879-1901) are a general history from the creation to 302 <span class="scs">A.H.</span>
(= <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 915). As a literary composition they do not rank very
high, which may be due partly to the author&rsquo;s years, partly to
the inequality of his sources, sometimes superabundant, sometimes
defective, partly perhaps to the somewhat hasty condensation
of his original draft. Nevertheless the value of the book is
very great: the author&rsquo;s selection of traditions is usually happy,
and the episodes of most importance are treated with most
fulness of detail, so that it deserves the high reputation it has
enjoyed from the first. This reputation rose steadily; there
were twenty copies (one of them written by Tabari&rsquo;s own hand)
in the library of the Fatimite caliph &#8219;Aziz (latter half of the 4th
century), whereas, when Saladin became lord of Egypt, the
princely library contained 1200 copies (Maqr&#299;z&#299;, i. 408 seq.).</p>

<p>The <i>Annals</i> soon came to be dealt with in various ways. They
were published in shorter form with the omission of the names
of authorities and of most of the poems cited; some passages
quoted by later writers are not found even in the Leiden edition.
On the other hand, some interpolations took place, one in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>275</span>
author&rsquo;s lifetime and perhaps by his own hand. Then many
supplements were written, <i>e.g.</i> by Fergh&#257;n&#299; (not extant) and by
Hamadhani (partly preserved in Paris). &#8219;Ar&#299;b of Cordova made
an abridgment, adding the history of the West and continuing
the story to about 975.<a name="fa6k" id="fa6k" href="#ft6k"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Ibn Mashkawaih wrote a history from
the creation to 980, with the purpose of drawing the lessons of
the story, following &#7788;abar&#299; closely, as far as his book is known,
and seldom recurring to other sources before the reign of
Moqtadir; what follows is his own composition and shows him
to be a writer of talent.<a name="fa7k" id="fa7k" href="#ft7k"><span class="sp">7</span></a> In 963 an abridgment of the <i>Annals</i>
was translated into Persian by Bal&#8219;am&#299;, who, however, interwove
many fables.<a name="fa8k" id="fa8k" href="#ft8k"><span class="sp">8</span></a> Ibn al-Ath&#299;r (d. 1234) abridged the whole work,
usually with judgment, but sometimes too hastily. Though he
sometimes glided lightly over difficulties, his work is of service
in fixing the text of &#7788;abar&#299;. He also furnished a continuation to
the year 1224. Later writers took &#7788;abar&#299; as their main authority,
but sometimes consulted other sources, and so add to our knowledge&mdash;especially
Ibn al-Jauz&#299; (d. 1201), who adds many
important details. These later historians had valuable help
from the biographies of famous men and special histories of
countries and cities, dynasties and princes, on which much
labour was spent from the 4th century from the Flight onwards.</p>

<p>The chief historians after &#7788;abar&#299; may be briefly mentioned
in chronological order. R&#257;z&#299; (d. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 932) wrote a <i>History of
Spain</i>; Eutychius (d. 940) wrote <i>Annals</i> (ed. L. Cheikho, Paris,
1906), which are very important because he gives the Christian
tradition; Suli (d. 946) wrote on the Abbasid caliphs, their
viziers and court poets; Mas&#8219;udi (<i>q.v.</i>) composed various historical
and geographical works (d. 956). Of &#7788;abar&#299;&rsquo;s contemporary
Hamza Ispah&#257;n&#299; (<i>c.</i> 940) we have the Annals (ed. Gottwaldt,
St Petersburg, 1844); Ibn al-Q&#363;&#7789;&#299;ya wrote a <i>History of
Spain</i>; Ibn Z&#363;l&#257;q (d. 997) a <i>History of Egypt</i>; &#8219;Otbi wrote the
<i>History of Mahmud of Ghazna</i>, at whose court he lived (printed
on the margin of the Egyptian edition of Ibn al-Ath&#299;r); Tha&#8219;lab&#299;
(d. 1036) wrote a well-known <i>History of the Old Prophets</i>; Abu
Nu&#8219;aim al-Ispah&#257;n&#299; (d. 1039) wrote a <i>History of Ispahan</i>, chiefly
of the scholars of that city; Tha&#8219;&#257;lib&#299; (d. c. 1038) wrote, <i>inter
alia</i>, a well-known <i>History of the Poets of his Time</i>, published at
Damascus, 1887; Bir&#363;n&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>) (d. 1048) takes a high place among
historians; Koda&#8219;&#299; (d. 1062) wrote a <i>Description of Egypt</i> and
also various historical pieces, of which some are extant; Ibn
S&#257;&#8219;id of Cordova (d. 1070) wrote a <i>View of the History of the
Various Nations</i>. Bagdad and its learned men found an excellent
historian in al-Kh&#257;tib al-Baghd&#257;d&#299; (d. 1071), and Spain
in Ibn Hayan (d. 1076), and half a century later in Ibn Khaq&#257;n
(d. 1135) and Ibn Bassam (d. 1147). Sam&#8219;ani (d. 1167) wrote
an excellent book on genealogies; &#8219;Um&#257;ra (d. 1175) wrote a
<i>History of Yemen</i> (ed. H.C. Kay, London, 1892); Ibn &#8219;Asaqir
(d. 1176) a <i>History of Damascus and her Scholars</i>, which is of great
value, and exists in whole or in part in several libraries. The
<i>Biographical Dictionary</i> of the Spaniard Ibn Pascual (d. 1182)
and that of Dabbi, a somewhat junior contemporary, are edited
in Codera&rsquo;s <i>Bibliotheca Arab. Hisp.</i> (1883-1885); Saladin found
his historian in the famous &#8219;Im&#257;d udd&#299;n (d. 1201) (Arabic text,
ed. C. Landberg, Leiden, 1888). Ibn ul-Jauz&#299;, who died in the
same year, has been already mentioned. Abdulwahid&rsquo;s <i>History
of the Almohades</i>, written in 1224, was published by Dozy (2nd
ed., 1881). Abdullatif or Abdallat&#299;f (d. 1232) is known by his
writings about Egypt (trans. de Sacy, 1810); Ibn al-Ath&#299;r
(d. 1233) wrote, in addition to the <i>Chronicle</i> already mentioned,
a <i>Biographical Dictionary of Contemporaries of the Prophet</i>.
Qifti (d. 1248) is especially known by his <i>History of Arabic
Philologists</i>. Sibt ibn al-Jauzi (d. 1256), grandson of the Ibn
al-Jauz&#299; already mentioned, wrote a great <i>Chronicle</i>, of which
much the larger part still exists. Codera has edited (Madrid,
1886) Ibn al-&#8219;Abbar&rsquo;s (d. 1260) <i>Biographical Lexicon</i>, already
known by Dozy&rsquo;s excerpts from it. Ibn al-&#8219;Ad&#299;m (d. 1262) is
famed for his <i>History of Aleppo</i>, and Abu Shama (d. 1267) wrote
a well-known <i>History of Saladin and Nureddin</i>, taking a great
deal from &#8219;Imad uddin. Ibn ab&#299; Usaibia (d. 1269) wrote a
<i>History of Physicians</i>, ed. A. Müller. The <i>History</i> of Ibn al-&#8219;Am&#299;d
(d. 1276), better known as Elmacin, was printed by Erpenius in
1625. Ibn Sa&#8219;&#299;d al-Maghrib&#299; (d. 1274 or 1286) is famous for his
histories, but still more for his geographical writings. The
noted theologian Naw&#257;w&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>; d. 1278) wrote a <i>Biographical
Dictionary of the Worthies of the First Ages of Islam</i>. Preeminent
as a biographer is Ibn Khallik&#257;n (<i>q.v.</i>; d. 1282), whose
much-used work was partly edited by de Slane and completely
by Wüstenfeld (1835-1840), and translated into English by the
former scholar (4 vols., 1843-1871).</p>

<p>Abu &#8219;l-Faraj, better known as Bar-Hebraeus (d. 1286), wrote,
besides his Syriac <i>Chronicle</i>, an Arabic <i>History of Dynasties</i> (ed.
E. Pocock, Oxford, 1663, Beirut, 1890). Ibn &#8219;Adhar&#299;&rsquo;s <i>History
of Africa and Spain</i> has been published by Dozy (2 vols., Leiden,
1848-1851), and the <i>Qartas</i> of Ibn ab&#299; Zar&#8219; by Tornberg (1843).
One of the best-known of Arab writers is Abulfeda (d. 1331) (<i>q.v.</i>).
Not less famous is the great <i>Encyclopaedia</i> of his contemporary
Nuwairi (d. 1332), but only extracts from it have been printed.
Ibn Sayyid an-N&#257;s (d. 1334) wrote a full biography of the
Prophet; Mizz&#299; (d. 1341) an extensive work on the men from
whom traditions have been derived. We still possess, nearly
complete, the great <i>Chronicle</i> of Dhahab&#299; (d. 1347), a very
learned biographer and historian. The geographical and historical
<i>Mas&#257;lik al-Abs&#257;r</i> of Ibn Fadlall&#257;h (d. 1348) is known at
present by extracts given by Quatremère and Amari. Ibn al-Wardi
(d. <i>c</i>. 1349), best known by his <i>Cosmography</i>, wrote a
<i>Chronicle</i> which has been printed in Egypt. &#7778;afad&#299; (d., 1363)
got a great name as a biographer. Yafi&#8219;&#299; (d. 1367) wrote a
<i>Chronicle of Islam</i> and <i>Lives of Saints</i>. Subk&#299; (d. 1369) published
<i>Lives of the Theologians of the Shafi&rsquo;ite School</i>. Of Ibn Kath&#299;r&rsquo;s
<i>History</i> the greatest part is extant. For the history of Spain
and the Maghrib the writings of Ibn al-Khat&#299;b (d. 1374) are of
acknowledged value. Another history, of which we possess the
greater part, is the large work of Ibn al-Fur&#257;t (d. 1404). Far
superior to all these, however, is the famous Ibn Khald&#363;n (<i>q.v.</i>)
(d. 1406). Of the historical works of the famous lexicographer
Fair&#363;zab&#257;d&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>) (d. 1414) only a <i>Life of the Prophet</i> remains.
Maqriz&#299; (d. 1442) is the subject of a separate article; Ibn Hajar
(d. 1448) is best known by his <i>Biographical Dictionary of Contemporaries
of the Prophet</i>, published in the <i>Bibliotheca Indica</i>.
Ibn &#8219;Arabsh&#257;h (d. 1450) is known by his <i>History of Timur</i>
(Leeuwarden, 1767). &#8219;Ain&#299; (d. 1451) wrote a <i>General History</i>,
still extant. Abu&#8219;l-Mah&#257;sin ibn Taghr&#299;bird&#299; (d. 1469) wrote at
length on the history of Egypt; the first two parts have been
published by Juynboll and Matthes, Leiden, 1855-1861. Flügel
has published Ibn Kotlubogha&rsquo;s <i>Biographies of the Hanifite
Jurists</i>. Ibn Shihna (d. 1485) wrote a <i>History of Aleppo</i>. Of
Sakhawi we possess a bibliographical work on the historians.
The polymath Suy&#363;t&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>) (d. 1505) contributed a <i>History of the
Caliphs</i> and many biographical pieces. Samh&#363;d&#299;&rsquo;s <i>History of
Medina</i> is known through the excerpts of Wüstenfeld (1861). Ibn
Iy&#257;s (d. 1524) wrote a <i>History of Egypt</i>, and Diarbekri (d. 1559)
a <i>Life of Mahomet</i>. To these names must be added Maqqari
(Makkari) (<i>q.v.</i>) and Hajji Khal&#299;fa (<i>q.v.</i>) (d. 1658). He made
use of European sources, and with him Arabic historiography
may be said to cease, though he had some unimportant successors.</p>

<p>A word must be said of the historical romances, the beginnings
of which go back to the first centuries of Islam. The interest in
all that concerned Mahomet and in the allusions of the Koran
to old prophets and races led many professional narrators to
choose these subjects. The increasing veneration paid to the
Prophet and love for the marvellous soon gave rise to fables about
his childhood, his visit to heaven, &amp;c., which have found their
way even into sober histories, just as many Jewish legends told
by the converted Jew Ka&#8219;b al-A&#7717;b&#257;r and by Wahb ibn Monabbih,
and many fables about the old princes of Yemen told by &#8219;Ab&#299;d,
are taken as genuine history (see, however, Mas&#8219;&#363;d&#299;, iv. 88 seq.).
A fresh field for romantic legend was found in the history of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span>
victories of Islam, the exploits of the first heroes of the
faith, the fortunes of &#8219;Al&#299; and his house. Then, too, history was
often expressly forged for party ends. The people accepted all
this, and so a romantic tradition sprang up side by side with the
historical, and had a literature of its own, the beginnings of which
must be placed as early as the 2nd century of the Flight. The
oldest specimens still extant are the fables about the conquest of
Spain ascribed to Ibn &#7716;ab&#299;b (d. 852), and those about the conquest
of Egypt and the West by Ibn &#8219;Abd al-Hakam (d. 871). In
these truth and falsehood are mingled. But most of the extant
literature of this kind is, in its present form, much more recent;
<i>e.g.</i> the <i>Story of the Death of Hosain</i> by the pseudo-Ab&#363; Mikhnaf
(translated by Wüstenfeld); the <i>Conquest of Syria</i> by Abu Ism&#257;&#8219;&#299;l
al-Basri (edited by Nassau Lees, Calcutta, 1854, and discussed by
de Goeje, 1864); the pseudo-Waqidi (see Hamaker, <i>De Expugnatione
Memphidis et Alexandriae</i>, Leiden, 1835); the pseudo-Ibn
Qutaiba (see Dozy, <i>Recherches</i>); the book ascribed to A&#8219;&#7779;am K&#363;f&#299;,
&amp;c. Further inquiry into the origin of these works is called for,
but some of them were plainly directed to stirring up fresh zeal
against the Christians. In the 6th century of the Flight some
of these books had gained so much authority that they were
used as sources, and thus many untruths crept into accepted
history.</p>
<div class="author">(M. J. de G.; G. W. T.)</div>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geography.</i>&mdash;The writing of geographical books naturally began
with the description of the Moslem world, and that for practical
purposes. Ibn Khord&#257;dhbeh, in the middle of the 9th century,
wrote a <i>Book of Roads and Provinces</i> to give an account of the highways,
the posting-stations and the revenues of the provinces. In
the same century Ya&#8219;q&#363;b&#299; wrote his <i>Book of Countries</i>, describing
specially the great cities of the empire. A similar work describing
the provinces in some detail was that of Qud&#257;ma or Kod&#257;ma (d.
922). Hamd&#257;ni (<i>q.v.</i>) was led to write his great geography of Arabia
by his love for the ancient history of his land. Muqaddasi
(Mokaddasi) at the end of the 10th century was one of the early travellers
whose works were founded on their own observation. The study of
Ptolemy&rsquo;s geography led to a wider outlook, and the writing of
works on geography (<i>q.v.</i>) in general. A third class of Arabian
geographical works were those written to explain the names of places
which occur in the older poets. Such books were written by Bakr&#299;
(<i>q.v.</i>) and Y&#257;q&#363;t (<i>q.v.</i>)<a name="fa9k" id="fa9k" href="#ft9k"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>

<p><i>Grammar and Lexicography.</i>&mdash;Arab tradition ascribes the first
grammatical treatment of the language to Ab&#363;-l-Aswad ud-Du&#8219;al&#299;
(latter half of the 7th century), but the certain beginnings of Arabic
grammar are found a hundred years later. The Arabs from early
times have always been proud of their language, but its systematic
study seems to have arisen from contact with Persian and from the
respect for the language of the Koran. In Ir&#257;k the two towns of
Basra and Kufa produced two rival schools of philologists. Bagdad
soon had one of its own (cf. G. Flügel&rsquo;s <i>Die grammatischen Schulen
der Araber</i>, Leipzig, 1862). Khal&#299;l ibn A&#7717;mad (718-791), an Arab
from Om&#257;n, of the school of Basra, was the first to enunciate the
laws of Arabic metre and the first to write a dictionary. His pupil
Sibawaihi (<i>q.v.</i>), a Persian, wrote the grammar known simply as
<i>The Book</i>, which is generally regarded in the East as authoritative
and almost above criticism. Other members of the school of Basra
were Abu &#8219;Ubaida (<i>q.v.</i>), Asma&#8219;&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>), Mubarrad (<i>q.v.</i>) and Ibn
Duraid (<i>q.v.</i>). The school of Kufa claimed to pay more attention
to the living language (spoken among the Bedouins) than to written
laws of grammar. Among its teachers were Kis&#257;&#8219;&#299;, the tutor of
Har&#363;n al-Rash&#299;d&rsquo;s sons, Ibn A&#8219;r&#257;bi, Ibn as-Sikk&#299;t (d. 857) and Ibn
ul-Anb&#257;ri (885-939). In the fourth century of Islam the two schools
of K&#363;fa and Basra declined in importance before the increasing
power of Bagdad, where Ibn Qutaiba, Ibn Jinn&#299; (941-1002) and
others carried on the work, but without the former rivalry of the
older schools. Persia from the beginning of the 10th century produced
some outstanding students of Arabic. Hamadh&#257;ni (d. 932)
wrote a book of synonyms (ed. L. Cheikho, Beirut, 1885). Jauhar&#299;
(<i>q.v.</i>) wrote his great dictionary the <i>Sah&#257;h</i>. Tha&#8219;&#257;libi (<i>q.v.</i>) and
Jurj&#257;n&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>) were almost contemporary, and a little later came
Zamakhshar&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>), whose philological works are almost as famous
as his commentary on the Koran. The most important dictionaries
of Arabic are late in origin. The immense work, <i>Lis&#257;n ul Arab</i>
(ed. 20 vols, B&#363;l&#257;q, 1883-1889), was compiled by Ibn Manz&#363;r
(1232-1311), the <i>Q&#257;m&#363;s</i> by Fair&#363;z&#257;b&#257;d&#299;, the <i>Taj ul&#8219;Ar&#363;s</i> (ed. 10 vols.,
B&#363;l&#257;q, 1890), founded on the <i>Q&#257;m&#363;s</i>, by Murtad&#257; uz-Zab&#299;d&#299; (1732-1790).</p>

<p><i>Scientific Literature.</i>&mdash;The literature of the various sciences is
dealt with elsewhere. It is enough here to mention that such
existed, and that it was not indigenous. It was in the early Abbasid
period that the scientific works of Greece were translated into Arabic,
often through the Syriac, and at the same time the influence of
Sanskrit works made itself felt. Astronomy seems in this way to
have come chiefly from India. The study of mathematics learned
from Greece and India was developed by Arabian writers, who in
turn became the teachers of Europe in the 16th century. Medical
literature was indebted for its origin to the works of Galen and the
medical school of Gondesapur. Many of the Arabian philosophers
were also physicians and wrote on medicine. Chemistry proper was
not understood, but Arabian writings on alchemy led Europe to it
later. So also the literature of the animal world (cf. Dam&#299;r&#299;) is not
zoological but legendary, and the works on minerals are practical
and not scientific. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arabian Philosophy</a></span> and historical sections
of such scientific articles as <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Astronomy</a></span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARABIAN PHILOSOPHY. W<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span>hat is known as &ldquo;Arabian&rdquo;
philosophy owed to Arabia little more than its name and its
language. It was a system of Greek thought, expressed in a
Semitic tongue, and modified by Oriental influences, called into
existence amongst the Moslem people by the patronage of their
more liberal princes, and kept alive by the intrepidity and zeal
of a small band of thinkers, who stood suspected and disliked
in the eyes of their nation. Their chief claim to the notice of
the historian of speculation comes from their warm reception
of Greek philosophy when it had been banished from its original
soil, and whilst western Europe was still too rude and ignorant
to be its home (9th to 12th century).</p>

<p>In the course of that exile the traces of Semitic or Mahommedan
influence gradually faded away, and the last of the line of
Saracenic thinkers was a truer exponent of the one
philosophy which they all professed to teach than
<span class="sidenote">Origin.</span>
the first. The whole movement is little else than a chapter in
the history of Aristotelianism. That system of thought, after
passing through the minds of those who saw it in the hazy
light of an orientalized Platonism, and finding many laborious
but narrow-purposed cultivators in the monastic schools of
heretical Syria, was then brought into contact with the ideas
and mental habits of Islam. But those in whom the two currents
converged did not belong to the pure Arab race. Of the so-called
Arabian philosophers of the East, al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;, Ibn-S&#299;n&#257;
and al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; were natives of Khorasan, Bokhara and the
outlying provinces of north-eastern Persia; whilst al-Kind&#299;,
the earliest of them, sprang from Basra, on the Persian Gulf,
on the debatable ground between the Semite and the Aryan.
In Spain, again, where Ibn-B&#257;jja, Ibn-Tufail and Ibn Rushd
rivalled or exceeded the fame of the Eastern schools, the Arabians
of pure blood were few, and the Moorish ruling class was deeply
intersected by Jewish colonies, and even by the natives of
Christian Spain. Thus, alike at Bagdad and at Cordova, Arabian
philosophy represents the temporary victory of exotic ideas
and of subject races over the theological one-sidedness of Islam,
and the illiterate simplicity of the early Saracens.</p>

<p>Islam had, it is true, a philosophy of its own among its theologians
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Religion</a></span>). It was with them that
the Moslem theology&mdash;the science of the word (<i>Kal&#257;m</i>)&mdash;first
came into existence. Its professors, the <i>Mut&#257;kallimun</i> (known
in Hebrew as <i>Medabberim</i>, and as <i>Loquentes</i> in the Latin versions),
may be compared with the scholastic doctors of the Catholic
Church. Driven in the first instance to speculation in theology
by the needs of their natural reason, they came, in after days,
when Greek philosophy had been naturalized in the Caliphate,
to adapt its methods and doctrines to the support of their views.
They employed a quasi-philosophical method, by which, according
to Maimonides, they first reflected how things ought to be
in order to support, or at least not contradict, their opinions,
and then, when their minds were made up with regard to this
imaginary system, declared that the world was no otherwise
constituted. The dogmas of creation and providence, of divine
omnipotence, chiefly exercised them; and they sought to assert
for God an immediate action in the making and the keeping
of the world. Space they looked upon as pervaded by atoms
possessing no quality or extension, and time was similarly divided
into innumerable instants. Each change in the constitution
of the atoms is a direct act of the Almighty. When the fire
burns, or the water moistens, these terms merely express the
habitual connexion which our senses perceive between one thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>277</span>
and another. It is not the man that throws a stone who is its
real mover: the supreme agent has for the moment created
motion. If a living being die, it is because God has created
the attribute of death; and the body remains dead, only because
that attribute is unceasingly created. Thus, on the one hand,
the object called the cause is denied to have any efficient power
to produce the so-called effect; and, on the other hand, the
regularities or laws of nature are explained to be direct interferences
by the Deity. The supposed uniformity and necessity
of causation is only an effect of custom, and may be at any
moment rescinded. In this way, by a theory which, according
to Averroes, involves the negation of science, the Moslem
theologians believed that they had exalted God beyond the
limits of the metaphysical and scientific conceptions of law,
form and matter; whilst they at the same time stood aloof
from the vulgar doctrines, attributing a causality to things.
Thus they deemed they had left a clear ground for the possibility
of miracles.</p>

<p>But at least one point was common to the theological and the
philosophical doctrine. Carrying out, it may be, the principles
of the Neo-Platonists, they kept the sanctuary of the Deity
securely guarded, and interposed between him and his creatures
a spiritual order of potent principles, from the Intelligence,
which is the first-born image of the great unity, to the Soul and
Nature, which come later in the spiritual rank. Of God the
philosophers said we could not tell what He is, but only what
He is not. The highest point, beyond which strictly philosophical
inquirers did not penetrate, was the active intellect,&mdash;a sort of
soul of the world in Aristotelian garb&mdash;the principle which
inspires and regulates the development of humanity, and in
which lies the goal of perfection for the human spirit. In theological
language the active intellect is described as an angel.
The inspirations which the prophet receives by angelic messengers
are compared with the irradiation of intellectual light, which
the philosopher wins by contemplation of truth and increasing
purity of life. But while the theologian incessantly postulated
the agency of that God whose nature he deemed beyond the pale
of science, the philosopher, following a purely human and natural
aim, directed his efforts to the gradual elevation of his part of
reason from its unformed state, and to its final union with the
controlling intellect which moves and draws to itself the spirits
of those who prepare themselves for its influences. The philosophers
in their way, like the mystics of Persia (the Sufites)
in another, tended towards a theory of the communion of man
with the spiritual world, which may be considered a protest
against the practical and almost prosaic definiteness of the creed
of Mahomet.</p>

<p>Arabian philosophy, at the outset of its career in the 9th
century, was able without difficulty to take possession of those
resources for speculative thought which the Latins had barely
achieved at the close of the 12th century by the slow process of
rediscovering the Aristotelian logic from the commentaries and
verses of Boëtius. What the Latins painfully accomplished,
owing to their fragmentary and unintelligent acquaintance with
ancient philosophy, was already done for the Arabians by the
scholars of Syria. In the early centuries of the Christian era,
both within and without the ranks of the church, the Platonic
tone and method were paramount throughout the East. Their
influence was felt in the creeds which formulated the orthodox
dogmas in regard to the Trinity and the Incarnation. But in
its later days the Neo-Platonist school came more and more to
find in Aristotle the best exponent and interpreter of the philosopher
whom they thought divine. It was in this spirit that
Porphyry, Themistius and Joannes Philoponus composed their
commentaries on the treatises of the Peripatetic system which,
modified often unconsciously by the dominant ideas of its
expositors, became in the 6th and 7th centuries the philosophy
of the Eastern Church. But the instrument which, in the hands
of John of Damascus (Damascenus), was made subservient to
theological interests, became in the hands of others a dissolvent
of the doctrines which had been reduced to shape under the prevalence
of the elder Platonism. Peripatetic studies became
the source of heresies; and conversely, the heretical sects
prosecuted the study of Aristotle with peculiar zeal. The church
of the Nestorians, and that of the Monophysites, in their several
schools and monasteries, carried on from the 5th to the 8th
century the study of the earlier part of the Organon, with almost
the same means, purposes and results as were found among the
Latin schoolmen of the earlier centuries. Up to the time when
the religious zeal of the emperor Zeno put a stop to the Nestorian
school at Edessa, this &ldquo;Athens of Syria&rdquo; was active in translating
and popularizing the Aristotelian logic. Their banishment
from Edessa in 489 drove the Nestorian scholars to Persia, where
the Sassanid rulers gave them a welcome; and there they continued
their labours on the Organon. A new seminary of logic
and theology sprang up at Nisibis, not far from the old locality;
and at Gandisapora (or Nishapur), in the east of Persia, there
arose a medical school, whence Greek medicine, and in its
company Greek science and philosophy, ere long spread over the
lands of Iran. Meanwhile the Monophysites had followed in
the steps of the Nestorians, multiplying Syriac versions of the
logical and medical science of the Greeks. Their school at Resaina
is known from the name of Sergius, one of the first of these translators,
in the days of Justinian; and from their monasteries
at Kinnesrin (Chalcis) issued numerous versions of the introductory
treatises of the Aristotelian logic. To the Isagoge of
Porphyry, the Categories and the Hermeneutica of Aristotle,
the labours of these Syrian schoolmen were confined. These
they expounded, translated, epitomized and made the basis of
their compilations, and the few who were bold enough to attempt
the Analytics seem to have left their task unaccomplished.</p>

<p>The energy of the Monophysites, however, began to sink with
the rise of the Moslem empire; and when philosophy revived
amongst them in the 13th century, in the person of Gregorius
Bat-Hebraeus (Abulfaragius) (1226-1286), the revival was due
to the example and influence of the Arabian thinkers. It was
otherwise with the Nestorians. Gaining by means of their
professional skill as physicians a high rank in the society of the
Moslem world, the Nestorian scholars soon made Bagdad familiar
with the knowledge of Greek philosophy and science which they
possessed. But the narrow limits of the Syrian studies, which
added to a scanty knowledge of Aristotle some acquaintance
with his Syrian commentators, were soon passed by the curiosity
and zeal of the students in the Caliphate. During the 8th and
9th centuries, rough but generally faithful versions of Aristotle&rsquo;s
principal works were made into Syriac, and then from the
Syriac into Arabic. The names of some of these translators,
such as Johannitius (Hunain ibn-Ish&#257;q), were heard even in the
Latin schools. By the labours of Hunain and his family the
great body of Greek science, medical, astronomical and mathematical,
became accessible to the Arab-speaking races. But for
the next three centuries fresh versions, both of the philosopher
and of his commentators, continued to succeed each other.</p>

<p>To the Arabians Aristotle represented and summed up Greek
philosophy, even as Galen became to them the code of Greek
medicine. They adopted the doctrine and system which the
progress of human affairs had made the intellectual aliment
of their Syrian guides. From first to last Arabian philosophers
made no claim to originality; their aim was merely to propagate
the truth of Peripateticism as it had been delivered to them.
It was with them that the deification of Aristotle began; and
from them the belief that in him human intelligence had reached
its limit passed to the later schoolmen (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Scholasticism</a></span>).
The progress amongst the Arabians on this side lies in a closer
adherence to their text, a nearer approach to the bare exegesis
of their author, and an increasing emancipation from control
by the tenets of the popular religion.</p>

<p>Secular philosophy found its first entrance amongst the
Saracens in the days of the early caliphs of the Abbasid dynasty,
whose ways and thoughts had been moulded by their
residence in Persia amid the influences of an older
<span class="sidenote">Under the Caliphate.</span>
creed, and of ideas which had in the last resort sprung
from the Greeks. The seat of empire had been transferred to
Bagdad, on the highway of Oriental commerce; and the distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
Khorasan became the favourite province of the caliph. Then
was inaugurated the period of Persian supremacy, during which
Islam was laid open to the full current of alien ideas and culture.
The incitement came, however, not from the people, but from
the prince: it was in the light of court favour that the colleges
of Bagdad and Nishapur first came to attract students from
every quarter, from the valleys of Andalusia as well as the
upland plains of Transoxiana. Mans&#363;r, the second of the
Abbasids, encouraged the appropriation of Greek science; but
it was al-Ma&rsquo;m&#363;n, the son of Har&#363;n al-Rash&#299;d, who deserves in
the Mahommedan empire the same position of royal founder
and benefactor which is held by Charlemagne in the history of
the Latin schools. In his reign (813-833) Aristotle was first
translated into Arabic. Orthodox Moslems, however, distrusted
the course on which their chief had entered, and his philosophical
proclivities became one ground for doubting as to his final
salvation.</p>

<p>In the eastern provinces the chief names of Arabian philosophy
are those known to the Latin schoolmen as Alkindius, Aliarabius,
Avicenna and Algazel, or under forms resembling these. The
first of these, Alkindius (<i>see</i> <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Kindi</a></span>), flourished at the court of
Bagdad in the first half of the 9th century. His claims to notice
at the present day rest upon a few works on medicine, theology,
music and natural science. With him begins that encyclopaedic
character&mdash;the simultaneous cultivation of the whole field of
investigation which is reflected from Aristotle on the Arabian
school. In him too is found the union of Platonism and Aristotelianism
expressed in Neo-Platonic terms. Towards the close
of the 10th century the presentation of an entire scheme of
knowledge, beginning with logic and mathematics, and ascending
through the various departments of physical inquiry to the
region of religious doctrine, was accomplished by a society
which had its chief seat at Basra, the native town of al-Kindi.
This society&mdash;the Brothers of Purity or Sincerity (Ikhw&#257;n us
Saf&#257;&rsquo;i)&mdash;divided into four orders, wrought in the interests of
religion no less than of science; and though its attempt to
compile an encyclopaedia of existing knowledge may have been
premature, it yet contributed to spread abroad a desire for
further information. The proposed reconciliation between
science and faith was not accomplished, because the compromise
could please neither party. The fifty-one treatises of which
this encyclopaedia consists are interspersed with apologues
in true Oriental style, and the idea of goodness, of moral perfection,
is as prominent an end in every discourse as it was
in the alleged dream of al-Ma&#8219;m&#363;n. The materials of the work
come chiefly from Aristotle, but they are conceived in a Platonizing
spirit, which places as the bond of all things a universal
soul of the world with its partial or fragmentary souls. Contemporary
with this semi-religious and semi-philosophical
society lived Alfarabius (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Far&#257;b&#299;</a></span>), who died in 950. His
paraphrases of Aristotle formed the basis on which Avicenna
constructed his system, and his logical treatises produced a
permanent effect on the logic of the Latin scholars. He gave the
tone and direction to nearly all subsequent speculations among
the Arabians. His order and enumeration of the principles
of being, his doctrine of the double aspect of intellect, and of
the perfect beatitude which consists in the aggregation of noble
minds when they are delivered from the separating barriers of
individual bodies, present at least in germ the characteristic
theory of Averroes. But al-Far&#257;b&#299; was not always consistent
in his views; a certain sobriety checked his speculative flights,
and although holding that the true perfection of man is reached
in this life by the elevation of the intellectual nature, he came
towards the close to think the separate existence of intellect
no better than a delusion.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the most illustrious name amongst the
Oriental Moslems was Avicenna (980-1037). His rank in the
medieval world as a philosopher was far beneath his
fame as a physician. Still, the logic of Albertus
<span class="sidenote">Avicenna.</span>
Magnus and succeeding doctors was largely indebted to him
for its formulae. In logic Avicenna starts from distinguishing
between the isolated concept and the judgment or assertion;
from which two primitive elements of knowledge there is artificially
generated a complete and scientific knowledge by the two
processes of definition and syllogism. But the chief interest
for the history of logic belongs to his doctrine in so far as it bears
upon the nature and function of abstract ideas. The question
had been suggested alike to East and West by Porphyry, and
the Arabians were the first to approach the full statement of the
problem. Far&#257;b&#299; had pointed out that the universal and individual
are not distinguished from each other as understanding
from the senses, but that both universal and individual are in
one respect intellectual, just as in another connexion they play
a part in perception. He had distinguished the universal essence
in its abstract nature, from the universal considered in relation
to a number of singulars. These suggestions formed the basis
of Avicenna&rsquo;s doctrine. The essences or forms&mdash;the <i>intelligibilia</i>
which constitute the world of real knowledge&mdash;may be looked
at in themselves (metaphysically), or as embodied in the things
of sense (physically), or as expressing the processes of thought
(logically). The first of these three points of view deals with the
form or idea as self-contained in the principles of its own being,
apart from those connexions and distinctions which it receives
in real (sensuous) science, and through the act of intellect.
Secondly, the form may be looked at as the similarity evolved
by a process of comparison, as the work of mental reflection,
and in that way as essentially expressing a relation. When
thus considered as the common features derived by examination
from singular instances, it becomes a universal or common term
strictly so called. It is intellect which first makes the abstract
idea a true universal. <i>Intellectus in formis agit universalitatem.</i>
In the third place, the form or essence may be looked upon as
embodied in outward things (<i>in singularibus propriis</i>), and
thus it is the type more or less represented by the members
of a natural kind. It is the designation of these outward things
which forms the &ldquo;first intention&rdquo; of names; and it is only at a
later stage, when thought comes to observe its own modes,
that names, looked upon as predicables and universals, are taken
in their &ldquo;second intention.&rdquo; Logic deals with such second intentions.
It does not consider the forms <i>ante multiplicitatem</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> as eternal ideas&mdash;nor in <i>multiplicitate</i>, <i>i.e.</i> as immersed in the
matter of the phenomenal world&mdash;but <i>post multiplicitatem</i>, <i>i. e.</i>
as they exist in and for the intellect which has examined and
compared. Logic does not come in contact with things, except
as they are subject to modification by intellectual forms. In
other words, universality, individuality and speciality are all
equally modes of our comprehension or notion; their meaning
consists in their setting forth the relations attaching to any
object of our conception. In the mind, <i>e.g.</i>, one form may be
placed in reference to a multitude of things, and as thus related
will be universal. The form animal, <i>e.g.</i>, is an abstract intelligible
or metaphysical idea. When an act of thought employs it as
a schema to unify several species, it acquires its logical aspect
(<i>respectus</i>) of generality; and the various living beings qualified
to have the name animal applied to them constitute the natural
class or kind. Avicenna&rsquo;s view of the universal may be compared
with that of Abelard, which calls it &ldquo;that whose nature
it is to be predicated of several,&rdquo; as if the generality became
explicit only in the act of predication, in the <i>sermo</i> or proposition,
and not in the abstract, unrelated form or essence. The three
modes of the universal before things, in things, and after things,
spring from Arabian influence, but depart somewhat from his
standpoint.</p>

<p>The place of Avicenna amongst Moslem philosophers is seen in
the fact that Shahrast&#257;n&#299; takes him as the type of all, and that
Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s attack against philosophy is in reality almost entirely
directed against Avicenna. His system is in the main a codification
of Aristotle modified by fundamental views of Neo-Platonist
origin, and it tends to be a compromise with theology. In order,
for example, to maintain the necessity of creation, he taught that
all things except God were admissible or possible in their own
nature, but that certain of them were rendered necessary by
the act of the creative first agent,&mdash;in other words, that the
possible could be transformed into the necessary. Avicenna&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>
theory of the process of knowledge is an interesting part of his
doctrine. Man has a rational soul, one face of which is turned
towards the body, and, by the help of the higher aspect, acts as
practical understanding; the other face lies open to the reception
and acquisition of the intelligible forms, and its aim is to become
a reasonable world, reproducing the forms of the universe and
their intelligible order. In man there is only the susceptibility
to reason, which is sustained and helped by the light of the active
intellect. Man may prepare himself for this influx by removing
the obstacles which prevent the union of the intellect with the
human vessel destined for its reception. The stages of this
process to the acquisition of mind are generally enumerated by
Avicenna as four; in this part he follows not Aristotle, but the
Greek commentator. The first stage is that of the hylic or
material intellect, a state of mere potentiality, like that of a child
for writing, before he has ever put pen to paper. The second
stage is called <i>in habitu</i>; it is compared to the case of a child
that has learned the elements of writing, when the bare possibility
is on the way to be developed, and is seen to be real. In
this period of half-trained reason, it appears as happy conjecture,
not yet transformed into art or science proper. When the power
of writing has been actualized, we have a parallel to the <i>intellectus
in actu</i>&mdash;the way of science and demonstration is entered. And
when writing has been made a permanent accomplishment,
or lasting property of the subject, to be taken up at will, it
corresponds to the <i>intellectus adeptus</i>&mdash;the complete mastery
of science. The whole process may be compared to the gradual
illumination of a body naturally capable of receiving light.
There are, however, grades of susceptibility to the active intellect,
<i>i.e.</i> in theological language, to communication with God and
his angels. Sometimes the receptivity is so vigorous in its
affinity, that without teaching it rises at one step to the vision
of truth, by a certain &ldquo;holy force&rdquo; above ordinary measure.
(In this way philosophy tried to account for the phenomenon
of prophecy, one of the ruling ideas of Islam.) But the active
intellect is not merely influential on human souls. It is the
universal giver of forms in the world.</p>

<p>In several points Avicenna endeavoured to give a <i>rationale</i>
of theological dogmas, particularly of prophetic rule, of miracles,
divine providence and immortality. The permanence of individual
souls he supports by arguments borrowed from those
of Plato. The existence of a prophet is shown to be a corollary
from a belief in God as a moral governor, and the phenomena
of miracles are required to evidence the genuineness of the
prophetic mission. Thus Avicenna, like his predecessors,
tried to harmonize the abstract forms of philosphy with the
religious faith of his nation. But his arguments are generally
vitiated by the fallacy of assuming what they profess to prove.
His failure is made obvious by the attack of Ghazali on the
tendencies and results of speculation.</p>

<p>To Ghaz&#257;l&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>) it seemed that the study of secular philosophy
had resulted in a general indifference to religion, and that the
scepticism which concealed itself under a pretence of
piety was destroying the life and purity of the nation.
<span class="sidenote">Ghaz&#257;l&#299;.</span>
With these views he carried into the fields of philosophy the aims
and spirit of the Moslem theologian. His restless life was the
reflex of a mental history disturbed by prolonged agitation.
Revolting, in the height of his success, against the current
creed, he began to examine the foundations of knowledge. The
senses are contradicted by one another, and disproved by
reason. Reason, indeed, professes to furnish us with necessary
truths; but what assurance have we that the verdicts of reason
may not be reversed by some higher authority? Ghaz&#257;l&#299; then
interrogated all the sects in succession to learn their criterion of
truth. He first applied to the theological schoolmen, who
grounded their religion on reason; but their aim was only to
preserve the faith from heresy. He turned to the philosophers,
and examined the accepted Aristotelianism in a treatise which
has come down to us&mdash;<i>The Destruction of the Philosophers</i>. He
assails them on twenty points of their mixed physical and metaphysical
peripateticism, from the statement of which, in spite
of his pretended scepticism, we can deduce some very positive
metaphysical opinions of his own. He claims to have shown
that the dogmas of the eternity of matter and the permanence
of the world are false; that their description of the Deity as
the demiurgos is unspiritual; that they fail to prove the existence,
the unity, the simplicity, the incorporeality or the knowledge
(both of species and accidents) of God; that their ascription
of souls to the celestial spheres is unproved; that their theory
of causation, which attributes effects to the very natures of
the causes, is false, for that all actions and events are to be
ascribed to the Deity; and, finally, that they cannot establish
the spirituality of the soul, nor prove its mortality. These criticisms
disclose nothing like a sceptical state of mind, but rather
a reversion from the metaphysical to the theological stage of
thought. He denies the intrinsic tendencies, or souls, by which
the Aristotelians explained the motion of the spheres, because
he ascribes their motion to God. The sceptic would have denied
both. G.H. Lewes censures Renan for asserting of Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s
theory of causation&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Hume n&rsquo;a rien dit plus</i>.&rdquo; It is true that
Ghaz&#257;l&#299; maintains that the natural law according to which effects
proceed inevitably from their causes is only custom, and that
there is no <i>necessary</i> connexion between them. But while Hume
absolutely denies the necessity, Ghaz&#257;l&#299; merely removes it one
stage farther back, and plants it in the mind of the Deity. This,
of course, is not metaphysics, but theology. Having, as he
believed, refuted the opinions of the philosophers, he next investigated
the pretensions of the Allegorists, who derived their
doctrines from an imam. These Arabian ultramontanes had
no word for the doubter. They could not, he says, even understand
the problems they sought to resolve by the assumption
of infallibility, and he turned again, in his despair, to the instructors
of his youth&mdash;the S&#363;f&#299;s. In their mystical intuition
of the laws of life, and absorption in the immanent Deity, he at
last found peace. This shows the true character of the treatise
which, alike in medieval and modern times, has been quoted as
containing an exposition of his opinions. The work called <i>The
Tendencies of the Philosophers</i>, translated in 1506, with the title
<i>Logica et Philosophia Algazelis Arabis</i>, contains neither the logic
nor the philosophy of Ghaz&#257;l&#299;. It is a mere abstract or statement
of the Peripatetic systems, and was made preliminary to
that <i>Destruction</i> of which we have already spoken.</p>

<p>This indictment against liberal thought from the standpoint
of the theological school was afterwards answered in Spain by
Averroes; but in Bagdad it heralded the extinction of the light
of philosophy. Moderate and compliant with the popular
religion as Alfarabius and Avicenna had always been, as compared
with their Spanish successor, they had equally failed to
conciliate the popular spirit, and were classed in the same category
with the heretic or the member of an immoral sect. The
12th century exhibits the decay of liberal intellectual activity
in the Caliphate, and the gradual ascendancy of Turkish races
animated with all the intolerance of semi-barbarian proselytes
to the Mahommedan faith. Philosophy, which had only sprung
up when the purely Arabian influences ceased to predominate,
came to an end when the sceptre of the Moslem world passed
away from the dynasty of Persia. Even in 1150 Bagdad had
seen a library of philosophical books burned by command of the
caliph Mostanjid; and in 1192 the same place might have witnessed
a strange scene, in which the books of a physician were
first publicly cursed, and then committed to the flames, while
their owner was incarcerated. Thus, while the Latin church
showed a marvellous receptivity for ethnic philosophy, and
assimilated doctrines which it had at an earlier date declared
impious, in Islam the theological system entrenched itself
towards the end of the 12th century in the narrow orthodoxy
of the Asharites, and reduced the votaries of Greek philosophy
to silence.</p>

<p>The same phenomena were repeated in Spain under the
Mahommedan rulers of Andalusia and Morocco, with this
difference, that the time of philosophical development
was shorter, and the heights to which Spanish thinkers
<span class="sidenote">In Spain.</span>
soared were greater. The reign of al-Hakam the Second (961-976)
inaugurated in Andalusia those scientific and philosophical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>
studies which were simultaneously prosecuted by the Society
of Basra. From Cairo, Bagdad, Damascus and Alexandria,
books both old and new were procured at any price for the library
of the prince; twenty-seven free schools were opened in Cordova
for the education of the poor; and intelligent knowledge was
perhaps more widely diffused in Mahommedan Spain than in
any other part of Europe at that day. The mosques of the city
were filled with crowds who listened to lectures on science and
literature, law and religion. But the future glory thus promised
was long postponed. The usurping successor of Hakam
found it a politic step to request the most notable doctors of the
sacred law to examine the royal library; and every book treating
of philosophy, astronomy and other forbidden topics was
condemned to the flames. But the spirit of research, fostered
by the fusion of races and the social and intellectual competition
thus engendered, was not crushed by these proceedings; and
for the next century and more the higher minds of Spain found
in Damascus and Bagdad the intellectual aliment which they
desired. At last, towards the close of the 11th century, the
long-pent spiritual energies of Mahommedan Spain burst forth
in a brief series of illustrious men. Whilst the native Spaniards
were narrowing the limits of the Moorish kingdoms, and whilst
the generally fanatical dynasty of the Almohades might have
been expected to repress speculation, the century preceding
the close of Mahommedan sway saw philosophy cultivated
by Avempace, Abubacer and Averroes. Even amongst the
Almohades there were princes, such as Yus&#363;f (who began his
reign in 1163) and Yaq&#363;b Almans&#363;r (who succeeded in 1184),
who welcomed the philosopher at their courts and treated him
as an intellectual compeer. But about 1195 the old distrust of
philosophy revived; the philosophers were banished in disgrace;
works on philosophical topics were ordered to be confiscated and
burned; and the son of Almans&#363;r condemned a certain Ibn-Hab&#299;b
to death for the crime of philosophizing.</p>

<p>Arabian speculation in Spain was heralded by Avicebron or
Ibn Gabirol (<i>q.v.</i>), a Jewish philosopher (1021-1058). About
a generation later the rank of Moslem thinkers was
introduced by Ab&#363;-Bakr Muhammad ibn Yahya,
<span class="sidenote">Avempace.</span>
surnamed Ibn-B&#257;jja, and known to the Latin world as Avempace.
He was born at Saragossa, and died comparatively young
at Fez in 1138. Besides commenting on various physical
treatises of Aristotle&rsquo;s, he wrote some philosophical essays,
notably one on the <i>Republic or Régime of the Solitary</i>, understanding
by that the organized system of rules, by obedience to
which the individual may rise from the mere life of the senses
to the perception of pure intelligible principles and may participate
in the divine thought which sustains the world. These
rules for the individual are but the image or reflex of the political
organization of the perfect or ideal state; and the man who
strives to lead this life is called the <i>solitary</i>, not because he withdraws
from society, but because, while in it, he guides himself
by reference to a higher state, an ideal society. Avempace
does not develop at any length this curious Platonic idea of the
perfect state. His object is to discover the highest end of human
life, and with this view he classifies the various activities of the
human soul, rejects such as are material or animal, and then
analyses the various spiritual forms to which the activities may
be directed. He points out the graduated scale of such forms,
through which the soul may rise, and shows that none are final
or complete in themselves, except the pure intelligible forms,
the ideas of ideas. These the intellect can grasp, and in so
doing it becomes what he calls <i>intellectus acquisitus</i>, and is in a
measure divine. This self-consciousness of pure reason is the
highest object of human activity, and is to be attained by the
speculative method. The intellect has in itself power to know
ultimate truth and intelligence, and does not require a mystical
illumination as Ghaz&#257;l&#299; taught. Avempace&rsquo;s principles, it is
clear, lead directly to the Averroistic doctrine of the unity of
intellect, but the obscurity and incompleteness of the Regime
do not permit us to judge how far he anticipated the later thinker.
(See Munk, <i>Mélanges de phil. juive et arabe</i>, pp. 383-410.)</p>

<p>The same theme was developed by Ibn.-&#7788;ufail (<i>q.v.</i>) in his
philosophical romance, called <i>Hayy ibn-Yakdh&#257;n</i> (the Living,
Son of the Waking One), best known by Pococke&rsquo;s Latin version,
as the <i>Philosophus Autodidactus</i>. It describes the process by
which an isolated truth-seeker detaches himself from his lower
passions, and raises himself above the material earth and the orbs
of heaven to the forms which are the source of their movement,
until he arrives at a union with the supreme intellect. The
experiences of the religious mystic are paralleled with the
ecstatic vision in which the philosophical hermit sees a world
of pure intelligences, where birth and decease are unknown.
It was this theory which Averroes (1126-1198), the last and
most famous of the thinkers of Moslem Spain, carried out to his
doctrine of the unity of intellect.</p>

<p>For Aristotle the reverence of Averroes was unbounded,
and to expound him was his chosen task. The uncritical receptivity
of his age, the defects of the Arabic versions,
the emphatic theism of his creed, and the rationalizing
<span class="sidenote">Averroes.</span>
mysticism of some Oriental thought, may have sometimes led
him astray, and given prominence to the less obvious features
of Aristotelianism. But in his conception of the relation
between philosophy and religion, Averroes had a light which
the Latins were without. The science, falsely so called, of the
several theological schools, their groundless distinctions and
sophistical demonstrations, he regarded as the great source
of heresy and scepticism. The allegorical interpretations and
metaphysics which had been imported into religion had taken
men&rsquo;s minds away from the plain sense of the Koran. God had
declared a truth meet for all men, which needed no intellectual
superiority to understand, in a tongue which each human soul
could apprehend. Accordingly, the expositors of religious
metaphysics, Ghaz&#257;l&#299; included, are the enemies of true religion,
because they make it a mere matter of syllogism. Averroes
maintains that a return must be made to the words and teaching
of the prophet; that science must not expend itself in dogmatizing
on the metaphysical consequences of fragments of doctrine
for popular acceptance, but must proceed to reflect upon and
examine the existing things of the world. Averroes, at the same
time, condemns the attempts of those who tried to give demonstrative
science where the mind was not capable of more than
rhetoric: they harm religion by their mere negations, destroying
an old sensuous creed, but cannot build up a higher and
intellectual faith.</p>

<p>In this spirit Averroes does not allow the fancied needs of
theological reasoning to interfere with his study of Aristotle,
whom he simply interprets as a truth-seeker. The points by
which he told on Europe were all implicit in Aristotle, but
Averroes set in relief what the original had left obscure, and
emphasized things which the Christian theologian passed by or
misconceived. Thus Averroes had a double effect. He was
the great interpreter of Aristotle to the later Schoolmen. On the
other hand, he came to represent those aspects of Peripateticism
most alien to the spirit of Christendom; and the deeply religious
Moslem gave his name to the anti-sacerdotal party, to the
materialists, sceptics and atheists, who defied or undermined
the dominant beliefs of the church.</p>

<p>On three points Averroes, like other Moslem thinkers, came
specially into relation, real or supposed, with the religious creed,
viz. the creation of the world, the divine knowledge of particular
things, and the future of the human soul.</p>

<p>The real grandeur of Averroes is seen in his resolute prosecution
of the standpoint of science in matters of this world, and in his
recognition that religion is not a branch of knowledge to be
reduced to propositions and systems of dogma, but a personal
and inward power, an individual truth which stands distinct
from, but not contradictory to, the universalities of scientific
law. In his science he followed the Greeks, and to the Schoolmen
he and his compatriots rightly seemed philosophers of the
ancient world. He maintained alike the claim of demonstrative
science with its generalities for the few who could live in that
ethereal world, and the claim of religion for all&mdash;the common
life of each soul as an individual and personal consciousness.
But theology, or the mixture of the two, he regarded as a source
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>
of evil to both&mdash;fostering the vain belief in a hostility of philosophers
to religion, and meanwhile corrupting religion by a
pseudo-science.</p>

<p>The latent nominalism of Aristotle only came gradually to
be emphasized through the prominence which Christianity
gave to the individual life, and, apart from passing notices as
in Abelard, first found clear enunciation in the school of Duns
Scotus. The Arabians, on the contrary, emphasized the idealist
aspect which had been adopted and promoted by the Neo-Platonist
commentators. Hence, to Averroes the eternity of the
world finds its true expression in the eternity of God. The
ceaseless movement of growth and change, which presents
matter in form after form as a continual search after a finality
which in time and movement is not and cannot be reached,
represents only the aspect the world shows to the physicist and
to the senses. In the eye of reason the full fruition of this desired
finality is already and always attained; the actualization, invisible
to the senses, is achieved now and ever, and is thus beyond
the element of time. This transcendent or abstract being is that
which the world of nature is always seeking. He is thought or
intellect, the actuality, of which movement is but the fragmentary
attainment in successive instants of time. Such a mind
is not in the theological sense a creator, yet the onward movement
is not the same as what some modern thinkers seem to
mean by development. For the perfect and absolute, the consummation
of movement is not generated at any point in the
process; it is an ideal end, which guides the operations of nature,
and does not wait upon them for its achievement. God is the
unchanging essence of the movement, and therefore its eternal
cause.</p>

<p>A special application of this relation between the prior perfect,
and the imperfect, which it influences, is found in the doctrine
of the connexion of the abstract (transcendent) intellect with
man. This transcendent mind is sometimes connected with
the moon, according to the theory of Aristotle, who assigned
an imperishable matter to the sphere beyond the sublunary,
and in general looked upon the celestial orbs as living and intelligent.
Such an intellect, named active or productive, as being
the author of the development of reason in man, is the permanent,
eternal thought, which is the truth of the cosmic and physical
movement. It is in man that the physical or sensible passes
most evidently into the metaphysical and rational. Humanity
is the chosen vessel in which the light of the intellect is revealed;
and so long as mankind lasts there must always be some individuals
destined to receive this light. What seems from the
material point of view to be the acquisition of learning, study
and a moral life, is from the higher point of view the manifestation
of the transcendent intellect in the individual. The preparation
of the heart and faculties gives rise to a series of grades
between the original predisposition and the full acquisition of
actual intellect. These grades in the main resemble those given
by Avicenna. But beyond these, Averroes claims as the highest
bliss of the soul a union in this life with the actual intellect.
The intellect, therefore, is one and continuous in all individuals,
who differ only in the degree which their illumination has
attained. Such was the Averroist doctrine of the unity of
intellect&mdash;the eternal and universal nature of true intellectual life.
By his interpreters it was transformed into a theory of one soul
common to all mankind, and when thus corrupted conflicted
not unreasonably with the doctrines of a future life, common
to Islam and Christendom.</p>

<p>Averroes, rejected by his Moslem countrymen, found a hearing
among the Jews, to whom Maimonides had shown the free paths
of Greek speculation. In the cities of Languedoc and
of Provence to which they had been driven by Spanish
<span class="sidenote">Opponents of Averoism.</span>
fanaticism, the Jews no longer used the learned Arabic,
and translations of the works of Averroes became
necessary. His writings became the text-book of Levi ben
Gerson at Perpignan, and of Moses of Narbonne. Meanwhile,
before 1250, Averroes became accessible to the Latin Schoolmen
by means of versions, accredited by the names of Michael Scot
and others. William of Auvergne is the first Schoolman who
criticizes the doctrines of Averroes, not, however, by name.
Albertus Magnus and St Thomas devote special treatises to an
examination of the Averroist theory of the unity of intellect,
which they labour to confute in order to establish the orthodoxy
of Aristotle. But as early as Aegidius Romanus (1247-1316).
Averroes had been stamped as the patron of indifference to
theological dogmas, and credited with the emancipation which
was equally due to wider experience and the lessons of the
Crusades. There had never been an absence of protest against
the hierarchical doctrine. Berengar of Tours (11th century) had
struggled in that interest, and with Abelard, in the 12th century,
the revolt against authority in belief grew loud. The dialogue
between a Christian, a Jew and a philosopher suggested a comparative
estimate of religions, and placed the natural religion of
the moral law above all positive revelations. Nihilists and
naturalists, who deified logic and science at the expense of
faith, were not unknown at Paris in the days of John of Salisbury.
In such a critical generation the words of Averroism
found willing ears, and pupils who outran their teacher. Paris
became the centre of a sceptical society, which the decrees of
bishops and councils, and the enthusiasm of the orthodox doctors
and knights-errant of Catholicism, were powerless to extinguish.
At Oxford Averroes told more as the great commentator. In
the days of Roger Bacon he had become an authority. Bacon,
placing him beside Aristotle and Avicenna, recommends the
study of Arabic as the only way of getting the knowledge which
bad versions made almost hopeless. In Duns Scotus, Averroes
and Aristotle are the unequalled masters of the science of proof;
and he pronounces distinctly the separation between Catholic
and philosophical truth, which became the watchword of Averroism.
By the 14th century Averroism was the common leaven
of philosophy; John Baconthorpe is the chief of Averroists, and
Walter Burley has similar tendencies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Averrcism had come to be regarded by the great
Dominican school as the arch-enemy of the truth. When the
emperor Frederick II. consulted a Moslem free-thinker on the
mysteries of the faith, when the phrase or legend of the &ldquo;Three
Impostors&rdquo; presented in its most offensive form the scientific
survey of the three laws of Moses, Christ and Mahomet, and
when the characteristic doctrines of Averroes were misunderstood,
it soon followed that his name became the badge of the
scoffer and the sceptic. What had begun with the subtle disputes
of the universities of Paris, went on to the materialist
teachers in the medical schools and the sceptical men of the world
in the cities of northern Italy. The patricians of Venice and
the lecturers of Padua made Averroism synonymous with
doubt and criticism in theology, and with sarcasm against the
hierarchy. Petrarch refuses to believe that any good thing can
come out of Arabia, and speaks of Averroes as a mad dog barking
against the church. In works of contemporary art Averroes
is at one time the comrade of Mahomet and Antichrist; at
another he lies with Arius and Sabellius, vanquished by the
lance of St Thomas.</p>

<p>It was in the universities of north Italy that Averroism
finally settled, and there for three centuries it continued as
a stronghold of Scholasticism to resist the efforts of
revived antiquity and of advancing science. Padua
<span class="sidenote">The school of Padua.</span>
became the seat of Averroist Aristotelianism; and,
when Padua was conquered by Venice in 1405, the printers of
the republic spread abroad the teaching of the professors in the
university. As early as 1300, at Padua, Petrus Aponensis, a
notable expositor of medical theories, had betrayed a heterodoxy
in faith; and John of Jandun, one of the pamphleteers on the
side of Louis of Bavaria, was a keen follower of Averroes, whom
he styles a &ldquo;perfect and most glorious physicist.&rdquo; Urbanus
of Bologna, Paul of Venice (d. 1428), and Cajetanus de Thienis
(1387-1465), established by their lectures and their discussions
the authority of Averroes; and a long list of manuscripts rests
in the libraries of Lombardy to witness the diligence of these
writers and their successors. Even a lady of Venice, Cassandra
Fedele, in 1480, gained her laurels in defence of Averroist theses.</p>

<p>With Pietro Pomponazzi (<i>q.v.</i>) in 1495, a brilliant epoch began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>
for the school of Padua. Questions of permanent and present
interest took the place of outworn scholastic problems. The
disputants ranged themselves under the rival commentators,
Alexander and Averroes; and the immortality of the soul became
the battle-ground of the two parties. Pomponazzi defended the
Alexandrist doctrine of the utter mortality of the soul, whilst
Agostino Nifo (<i>q.v.</i>), the Averroist, was entrusted by Leo X.
with the task of defending the Catholic doctrine. The parties
seemed to have changed when Averroism thus took the side of
the church; but the change was probably due to compulsion.
Nifo had edited the works of Averroes (1495-1497); but his
expressions gave offence to the dominant theologians, and he
had to save himself by distinguishing his personal faith from his
editorial capacity. Alessandro Achillini, the persistent philosophical
adversary of Pomponazzi, both at Padua and subsequently
at Bologna, attempted, along with other moderate but
not brilliant Averroists, to accommodate their philosophical
theory with the requirements of Catholicism. It was this comparatively
mild Averroism, reduced to the merely explanatory
activity of a commentator, which continued to be the official
dogma at Padua during the 16th century. Its typical representative
is Marc-Antonio Zimara (d. 1552), the author of a reconciliation
between the tenets of Averroes and those of Aristotle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in 1497, Aristotle was for the first time expounded
in Greek at Padua. Plato had long been the favourite study
at Florence; and Humanists, like Erasmus, Ludovicus
Vives and Nizolius, enamoured of the popular philosophy
<span class="sidenote">Summary.</span>
of Cicero and Quintilian, poured out the vials of their
contempt on scholastic barbarism with its &ldquo;impious and thrice-accursed
Averroes.&rdquo; The editors of Averroes complain that
the popular taste had forsaken them for the Greek. Nevertheless,
while Fallopius, Vesalius and Galileo were claiming attention
to their discoveries, G. Zabarella, Francesco Piccolomini
(1520-1604) and Cesare Cremonini (1550-1631) continued the
traditions of Averroism, not without changes and additions.
Cremonini, the last of them, died in 1631, after lecturing twelve
years at Ferrara, and forty at Padua. The great educational
value of Arabian philosophy for the later schoolmen consisted
in its making them acquainted with an entire Aristotle. At
the moment when it seemed as if everything had been made
that could be made out of the fragments of Aristotle, and the
compilations of Capella, Cassiodorus and others, and when
mysticism and scepticism seemed the only resources left for
the mind, the horizon of knowledge was suddenly widened by
the acquisition of a complete Aristotle. Thus the mistakes
inevitable in the isolated study of an imperfect <i>Organon</i> could
not henceforth be made. The real bearing of old questions,
and the meaninglessness of many disputes, were seen in the
new conception of Aristotelianism given by the <i>Metaphysics</i>
and other treatises. The former Realism and Nominalism were
lifted into a higher phase by the principle of the universalizing
action of intellect&mdash;<i>Intellectus in formis agit universalitatem</i>.
The commentaries of the Arabians in this respect supplied
nutriment more readily assimilated by the pupils than the pure
text would have been.</p>

<p>Arabian philosophy, whilst it promoted the exegesis of Aristotle
and increased his authority, was not less notable as the source
of the separation between theology and philosophy. Speculation
fell on irreligious paths. In many cases the heretical movement
was due less to foreign example than to the indwelling tendencies
of the dominant school of realism. But it is not less certain that
the very considerable freedom of the Arabians from theological
bias prepared the time when philosophy shook off its ecclesiastical
vestments. In the hurry of first terror, the church struck
Aristotle with the anathema launched against innovations in
philosophy. The provincial council of Paris in 1209, which
condemned Amalricus and his followers, as well as David of
Dinant&rsquo;s works, forbade the study of Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Natural Philosophy</i>
and the <i>Commentaries</i>. In 1215 the same prohibition
was repeated, specifying the <i>Metaphysics</i> and <i>Physics</i>, and the
<i>Commentaries</i> by the Spaniard Mauritius (<i>i.e.</i> probably Averroes).
Meanwhile Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, accepting
the exegetical services of the Arabians, did their best to controvert
the obnoxious doctrine of the Intellect, and to defend the
orthodoxy of Aristotle against the unholy glosses of infidels.
But it is doubtful whether even they kept as pure from the
infection of illegitimate doctrine as they supposed. The tide
meanwhile flowed in stronger and stronger. In 1270 Étienne
Tempier, bishop of Paris, supported by an assembly of theologians,
anathematized thirteen propositions bearing the stamp
of Arabian authorship; but in 1277 the same views and others
more directly offensive to Christians and theologians had to be
censured again. Raymond Lully, in a dialogue with an infidel
thinker, broke a lance in support of the orthodox doctrine, and
carried on a crusade against the Arabians in every university;
and a disciple of Thomas Aquinas drew up a list (<i>De erroribus
philosophorum</i>) of the several delusions and errors of each of
the thinkers from Kindi to Averroes. Strong in their conviction
of the truth of Aristotelianism, the Arabians carried out their
logical results in the theological field, and made the distinction
of necessary and possible, of form and matter, the basis of conclusions
in the most momentous questions. They refused to
accept the doctrine of creation because it conflicted with the
explanation of forms as the necessary evolution of matter.
They denied the particular providence of God, because knowledge
in the divine sphere did not descend to singulars. They excluded
the Deity from all direct action upon the world, and
substituted for a cosmic principle the active intellect,&mdash;thus
holding a form of Pantheism. But all did not go the same length
in their divergence from the popular creed.</p>

<p>The half-legendary accounts which attribute the introduction
of Arabian science to Gerbert, afterwards Pope Sylvester II.,
to Constantinus Africanus and to Adelard of Bath, if they have
any value, refer mainly to medical science and mathematics.
It was not till about the middle of the 12th century that under
the patronage of Raymond, archbishop of Toledo, a society of
translators, with the archdeacon Dominicus Gundisalvi at their
head, produced Latin versions of the <i>Commentaries</i> of Avicenna,
and Ghazali, of the <i>Fons Vitae</i> of Avicebron, and of several
Aristotelian treatises. The working translators were converted
Jews, the best-known among them being Joannes Avendeath.
With this effort began the chief translating epoch for Arabic
works. Avicenna&rsquo;s <i>Canon of Medicine</i> was first translated into
Latin by Gerard of Cremona (d. 1187), to whom versions of other
medical and astronomical works are due. The movement
towards introducing Arabian science and philosophy into Europe,
however, culminated under the patronage of the emperor
Frederick II. (1212-1250). Partly from superiority to the
narrowness of his age, and partly in the interest of his struggle
with the Papacy, this <i>Malleus ecclesiae Romanae</i> drew to his
court those savants whose pursuits were discouraged by the
church, and especially students in the forbidden lore of the
Arabians. He is said to have pensioned Jews for purposes of
translation. One of the scholars to whom Frederick gave a
welcome was Michael Scot, the first translator of Averroes.
Scot had sojourned at Toledo about 1217, and had accomplished
the versions of several astronomical and physical treatises,
mainly, if we believe Roger Bacon, by the labours of a Jew named
Andrew. But Bacon is apparently hypercritical in his estimate of
the translators from the Arabic. Another protégé of Frederick&rsquo;s
was Hermann the German (Alemannus), who, between the years
1243 and 1256, translated amongst other things a paraphrase of
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; on the <i>Rhetoric</i>, and of Averroes on the <i>Poetics</i> and
<i>Ethics</i> of Aristotle. Jewish scholars held an honourable place
in transmitting the Arabian commentators to the schoolmen.
It was amongst them, especially in Maimonides, that Aristotelianism
found refuge after the light of philosophy was extinguished
in Islam; and the Jewish family of the Ben-Tibbon
were mainly instrumental in making Averroes known to southern
France.</p>

itself in the belief that the soul perished and was restored to life
along with the body. We may compare Tatian&rsquo;s view of the

<p><span class="bold">ARABI PASHA<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1839-&emsp;&emsp;), more correctly <span class="sc">Ahmad &#8219;Ar&#257;b&#299;</span>,
to which in later years he added the epithet <i>al-Misr&#299;</i>, &ldquo;the
Egyptian,&rdquo; Egyptian soldier and revolutionary leader, was born
in Lower Egypt in 1839 or 1840 of a fellah family. Having
entered the army as a conscript he was made an officer by Said
Pasha in 1862, and was employed in the transport department
in the Abyssinian campaign of 1875 under Ismail Pasha. A
charge of peculation, unproved, was made against him in connexion
with this expedition and he was placed on half-pay.
During this time he joined a secret society formed by Ali Rubi
with the object of getting rid of Turkish officers from the
Egyptian army. Arabi also attended lectures at the mosque
El Azhar and acquired a reputation as an orator. In 1878 he
was employed by Ismail in fomenting a disturbance against the
ministry of Nubar, Rivers Wilson and de Blignières, and received
in payment a wife from Ismail&rsquo;s harem and the command of a
regiment. This increased his influence with the secret society,
which, under the feeble government of Tewfik Pasha and the
Dual Control, began to agitate against Europeans. In all that
followed Arabi was put forward as the leader of the discontented
Egyptians; he was in reality little more than the mouthpiece
and puppet of abler men such as Ali Rubi and Mahmud
Sami. On the 1st of February 1881 Arabi and two other
Egyptian colonels, summoned before a court-martial for acts
of disobedience, were rescued by their soldiers, and the khedive
was forced to dismiss his then minister of war in favour of
Mahmud Sami. A military demonstration on the 8th of
September 1881, led by Arabi, forced the khedive to increase
the numbers and pay of the army, to substitute Sherif Pasha
for Riaz Pasha as prime minister, and to convene an assembly
of notables. Arabi became under-secretary for war at the
beginning of 1882, but continued his intrigues. The assembly
of notables claimed the right of voting the budget, and thus
came into conflict with the foreign controllers who had been
appointed to guard the interests of the bondholders in the
management of the Egyptian finances. Sherif fell in February,
Mahmud Sami became prime minister, and Arabi (created a
pasha) minister of war. Arabi, after a brief fall from office,
acquired a dictatorial power that alarmed the British government.
British and French warships went to Alexandria at the
beginning of June; on the 11th of that month rioting in that
city led to the sacrifice of many European lives. Order could
only be restored through the intervention of Arabi, who now
adopted a more distinctly anti-European attitude. His arming
of the forts at Alexandria was held to constitute a menace to
the British fleet. On the refusal of France to co-operate, the
British fleet bombarded the forts (11th July), and a British force,
under Sir Garnet Wolseley, defeated Arabi on the 13th of
September at Tel-el-Kebir. Arabi fled to Cairo where he surrendered,
and was tried (3rd of December) for rebellion. In
accordance with an understanding made with the British
representative, Lord Dufferin, Arabi pleaded guilty, and sentence
of death was immediately commuted to one of banishment for
life to Ceylon. The same sentence was passed on Mahmud
Sami and others. After Arabi&rsquo;s exile had lasted for nearly
twenty years, however, the khedive Abbas II. exercised his
prerogative of mercy, and in May 1901 Arabi was permitted to
return to Egypt. Arabi, as has been said, was rather the figurehead
than the inspirer of the movement of 1881-1882; and
was probably more honest, as he was certainly less intelligent,
than those whose tool, in a large measure, he was. The movement
which he represented in the eye of Europe, whatever the
motives of its leaders, &ldquo;was in its essence a genuine revolt
against misgovernment,&rdquo;<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and it was a dim recognition of this
fact which led Arabi to style himself &ldquo;the Egyptian.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARABISTAN<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> (formerly <span class="sc">Khuzistan</span>), a province of Persia,
bounded on the S. by the Persian Gulf, on the W. by Turkish
territory, on the N. by Luristan and on the E. by the Bakhtiari
district and Fars. It has its modern name, signifying &ldquo;land of
the Arabs,&rdquo; from the Arabs who form the bulk of the population,
and is subdivided into the districts of Muhamrah, Fellahiyeh
(the old Dorak), Ram Hormuz (popularly known as Ramiz),
Havizeh, Shushter and Dizful. It has a population of about
200,000 and pays a yearly revenue of about £30,000. The soil
is very fertile, but since the dam over the Karun at Ahvaz was
swept away and the numerous canals which diverted the waters
of the river for irrigation became useless, a great part of the
province is uncultivated, and most of the crops and produce
depend for water on rainfall and wells. The climate is hot, and
in the low-lying, swampy districts very unhealthy; the prevailing
winds are north-west and south-east, the former hot and
dry from the arid districts west of Mesopotamia, the latter bearing
much moisture from the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean.
The principal Arab tribes are the Kab (generally known as
Chaab) and Beni Lam, the former mostly settled in towns and
villages and by religion Shi&rsquo;ites, the latter nomads and Sunnites.
The staples of food are dates and fish in the south, elsewhere
the produce of the herds and flocks and rice, wheat and barley.
Other products are maize, cotton, silk and indigo, and the manufactures
include carpets without pile, coarse woollens, cottons
and silk nettings. Dyeing is extensively carried on in Dizful
where most of the indigo is grown.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARABS,<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> the name given to that branch of the Semitic race
which from the earliest historic times inhabited the south-western
portion of the Arabian peninsula. The name, to-day
the collective term for the overwhelming majority of the surviving
Semitic peoples, was originally restricted to the nomad
tribes who ranged the north of the peninsula east of Palestine
and the Syro-Arabian desert. In this narrow sense &ldquo;Arab&rdquo;
is used in the Assyrian inscriptions, in the Old Testament and
in the Minaean inscriptions. Before the Christian era it had
come to include all the inhabitants of the peninsula. This, it is
suggested, may have been due to the fact that the &ldquo;Arabs&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>
were the chief people near the Greek and Roman colonies in
Syria and Mesopotamia. Classical writers use the term both
in its local and general sense. The Arabs to-day occupy, besides
Arabia, a part of Mesopotamia, the western shores of the Red
Sea, the eastern coast of the Persian Gulf and the north of
Africa. The finest type of the race is found in south Arabia
among the Ariba Arabs, among the mountaineers of Hadramut
and Yemen and among the Bedouin tribes roaming over the
interior of central and northern Arabia. The Arabs of the
coasts and those of Mesopotamia are hybrids, showing Turkish,
Negroid and Hamitic crossings. The people of Syria and
Palestine are hybrids of Arab, Phoenician and Jewish descent.
The theory that early Arab settlements were made on the east
coast of Africa as far as Sofala south of the Zambezi, is without
foundation; the earliest Arab settlement on the east coast of
Africa that can be proved is Magadoxo (Mukdishu) in the 10th
century, and the ruined cities of Mashonaland, once supposed
to be the remains of Arab settlements, are now known to be
of medieval African origin. On the East African coast-lands
Arab influence is still considerable. Traces of the Arab type
are met with in Asia Minor, the Caucasus, western Persia and
India, while the influence of the Arab language and civilization
is found in Europe (Malta and Spain), China and Central
Asia.</p>

<p>The Arabs are at once the most ancient as they in many ways
are the purest surviving type of the true Semite. Certainly
the inhabitants of Yemen are not, and in historic
times never were, pure Semites. Somali and other
<span class="sidenote">Ethnology.</span>
elements, generally described under the collective racial name
of Hamitic, are clearly traceable; but the inland Arabs still
present the nearest approach to the primitive Semitic type.
The origin of the Arab race can only be a matter of conjecture.
From the remotest historic times it has been divided into two
branches, which from their geographical position it is simplest
to call the North Arabians and the South Arabians. Arabic
and Jewish tradition trace the descent of the latter from Joktan
(Arabic <i>Kahtan</i>) son of Heber, of the former from Ishmael.
The South Arabians&mdash;the older branch&mdash;were settled in the
south-western part of the peninsula centuries before the uprise
of the Ishmaelites. These latter include not only Ishmael&rsquo;s
direct descendants through the twelve princes (Gen. xxv. 16),
but the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, Midianites and other
tribes. This ancient and undoubted division of the Arab race
&mdash;roughly represented to-day by the universally adopted
classification into Arabs proper and Bedouin Arabs (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bedouins</a></span>)-has caused much dispute among ethnologists.
All authorities agree in declaring the race to be Semitic in the
broadest ethnological signification of that term, but some
thought they saw in this division of the race an indication of a
dual origin. They asserted that the purer branch of the Arab
family was represented by the sedentary Arabs who were of
Hamitic (Biblical Cushite), <i>i.e.</i> African ancestry, and that the
nomad Arabs were Arabs only by adoption, and were nearer
akin to the true Semite as sons of Ishmael. Many arguments
were adduced in support of this theory, (1) The unquestioned
division in remote historic times of the Arab race, and the immemorial
hostility between the two branches. (2) The concurrence
of pre-Islamitic literature and records in representing the
first settlement of the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Arab as made in the extreme
south-western part of the peninsula, near Aden. (3) The use
of Himyar, &ldquo;dusky&rdquo; or &ldquo;red&rdquo; (suggesting African affinities),
as the name sometimes for the ruling class, sometimes for the
entire people. (4) The African affinities of the Himyaritic
language. (5) The resemblance of the grammar of the Arabic
now spoken by the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Arabs, where it differs from that
of the North, to the Abyssinian grammar. (6) The marked
resemblance of the pre-Islamitic institutions of Yemen and its
allied provinces-its monarchies, courts, armies and serfs&mdash;to
the historical Africo-Egyptian type and even to modern Abyssinia.
(7) The physique of the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Arab, the shape and
size of the head, the slenderness of the lower limbs, all suggesting
an African rather than an Asiatic origin. (8) The habits of the
people, viz. their sedentary rather than nomad occupations,
their fondness for village life, for dancing, music and society,
their cultivation of the soil, having more in common with African
life than with that of the western Asiatic continent. (9) The
extreme facility of marriage which exists in all classes of the
southern Arabs with the African races, the fecundity of such
unions and the slightness or even total absence of any caste
feeling between the dusky &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Arab and the still darker
African, pointing to a community of origin. And further arguments
were found in the characteristics of the Bedouins, their
pastoral and nomad tendencies; the peculiarities of their idiom
allied to the Hebrew; their strong clan feeling, their continued
resistance to anything like regal power or centralized
organization.</p>

<p>Such, briefly, were the more important arguments; but
latterly ethnologists are inclined to agree that there is little
really to be said for the African ancestry theory and that the
Arab race had its beginning in the deserts of south Arabia,
that in short the true Arabs are aborigines.</p>

<p>Mahommedans call the centuries before the Prophet&rsquo;s birth
waqt-el jahil&#299;ya, &ldquo;the time of ignorance,&rdquo; but the fact is that
the Arab world has in some respects never since reached so high
a level as it had in those days which it suits Moslems to paint in
dreary colours. Writing was a fine art and poetry flourished.
Eloquence was an accomplishment all strove to acquire, and
each year there were assemblies, lasting sometimes a month,
which were devoted to contests of skill among the orators and
poets, to listen to whose friendly rivalry tribesmen journeyed
long distances. Last, that surest index of a people&rsquo;s
civilization&mdash;the treatment of women&mdash;contrasted very favourably with
their position under the Koran. Women had rights and were
respected. The veil and the harem system were unknown before
Mahomet. According to Nöldeke the Nabataean inscriptions
and coins show that women held a high social position in northern
Arabia, owning large estates and trading independently. Polyandry
and polygamy, it is true, were practised, but the right of
divorce belonged to the woman as well as the man. Two kinds
of marriage were celebrated. One was a purely personal contract,
with no witnesses, the wife not leaving her home or passing
under marital authority. The other was a formal marriage, the
woman becoming subject to her husband by purchase or capture.
Even captive women were not kept in slavery. Arabic wealth
and culture had indeed thus early reached a stage which justified
Professor Robertson Smith in writing, &ldquo;In this period the name
of Arab was associated to Western writers with ideas of effeminate
indolence and peaceful opulence ... the golden age of
Yemen.&rdquo; But long before Mahomet&rsquo;s time this early Arab
predominance was at an end, possibly due in great measure
to the loss of the caravan trade through the increase of shipping.
The abandonment of great cities and the ruin of many tribes
contributed to the apparent nationalization of the Arab peoples.
Though the traditional jealousy and hostility of the two branches,
the Yemenites and Maadites or Ishmaelites, remained, the Arab
world had attained by the levelling process of common misfortune
the superficial unity it presents to-day. The nation thus
formed, never a nation in the strict sense of the word, was
distinctively and thoroughly Semitic in character and language,
and has remained unchanged to the present day. The sporadic
brilliancy of the ancient Arab kingdoms gave place to a social
and political lethargy, the continuation of which for many centuries
made the uprise of Saracenic empires seem a miracle to
a world ignorant of the Arab past. The Arab race up to
Mahomet&rsquo;s day had been in the main pagan. Monotheism, if
it ever prevailed, early gave place to sun and star worship,
or simple idolatry. Professor Robertson Smith suggests that
totemism was the earliest form of Arabian idolatry, and that
each tribe had its sacred animal. This he supports by the fact
that some tribal names were derived from those of animals, and
that animal-worship was not unknown in Arabia. What seems
certain is that Arab religion was of a complex hybrid nature,
not much to be wondered at when one remembers that Arabia
was the asylum of many religious refugees, Zoroastrians, Jews,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>
Christians. In the later pre-Islamitic times spirits, or jinns,
as they were called, of which each tribe or family had its
own, were worshipped, and there was but a vague idea of a
Supreme Being. Images of the jinns to the number of
360, one for each day of the lunar year, were collected in
the temple at Mecca, the chief seat of their worship. That
worship was of a sanguinary nature. Human sacrifice was
fairly frequent. Under the guise of religion female infanticide
was a common practice. At Mecca the great object of worship
was a plain black stone, and to it pilgrimages were made from
every part of Arabia. This stone was so sacred to the Arabs
that even Mahomet dared not dispense with it, and it remains
the central object of sanctity in the Ka&rsquo;ba to-day. The temples
of the Sabaeans and the Minaeans were built east of their
cities, a fact suggesting sun-worship, yet this is not believed to
have been the cult of the Minaeans. Common to both was the
worship of Attar, the male Ashtoreth.</p>

<p>With the appearance of Mahomet the Arabs took anew a place
in the world&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>Physically the Arabs are one of the strongest and
noblest races of the world. Baron de Larrey, surgeon-general to
Napoleon on his expedition to Egypt and Syria,
writes: &ldquo;Their physical structure is in all respects
<span class="sidenote">Physique.</span>
more perfect than that of Europeans; their organs of sense
exquisitely acute, their size above the average of men in general,
their figure robust and elegant, their colour brown; their intelligence
proportionate to their physical perfection and without
doubt superior, other things being equal, to that of other
nations.&rdquo; The typical Arab face is of an oval form, lean-featured;
the eyes a brilliant black, deep-set under bushy
eyebrows; nose aquiline, forehead straight but not high. In
body the Arab is muscular and long-limbed, but lean. Deformed
individuals or dwarfs are rare among Arabs; nor, except
leprosy, which is common, does any disease seem to be hereditary
among them. They often suffer from ophthalmia, though not
in the virulent Egyptian form. They are scrupulously clean
in their persons, and take special care of their teeth, which are
generally white and even. Simple and abstemious in their
habits, they often reach an extreme yet healthy old age; nor
is it common among them for the faculties of the mind to give
way sooner than those of the body.</p>

<p>Thus, physically, they yield to few races, if any, of mankind;
mentally, they surpass most, and are only kept back in the
march of progress by the remarkable defect of organizing
power and incapacity for combined action.
<span class="sidenote">Character.</span>
Lax and imperfect as are their forms of government, it is with
impatience that even these are borne; of the four caliphs
who alone reigned&mdash;if reign theirs could be called&mdash;in Arabia
proper, three died a violent death; and of the Wahhabi princes,
the most genuine representatives in later times of pure Arab
rule, almost all have met the same fate. The Arab face, which
is not unkindly, but never smiling, expresses that dignity and
gravity which are typical of the race. While the Arab is always
polite, good-natured, manly and brave, he is also revengeful,
cruel, untruthful and superstitious. Of the Arab nature Burckhardt
(other authorities, <i>e.g.</i> Barth and Rohlfs, are far less complimentary)
wrote: &ldquo;The Arab displays his manly character when
he defends his guest at the peril of his own life, and submits
to the reverses of fortune, to disappointment and distress, with
the most patient resignation. He is distinguished from a Turk
by the virtues of pity and gratitude. The Turk is cruel, the Arab
of a more kind temper; he pities and supports the wretched, and
never forgets the generosity shown to him even by an enemy.&rdquo;
The Arab will lie and cheat and swear false oaths, but once his
word is pledged he may be trusted to the last. There are some
oaths such as <i>Wallah</i> (by Allah) which mean nothing, but such
an oath as the threefold one with <i>wa, bi</i> and <i>ta</i> as
particles of swearing the meanest thief will not break. In temper, or
at least in the manifestation of it, the Arab is studiously calm;
and he rarely so much as raises his voice in a dispute. But this
outward tranquillity covers feelings alike keen and permanent;
and the remembrance of a rash jest or injurious word, uttered
years before, leads only too often to that blood-revenge which
is a sacred duty everywhere in Arabia.</p>

<p>There exist, however, marked tribal or almost semi-national
diversities of character among the Arabs. Thus, the inhabitants
of Hejaz are noted for courtesy and blamed for fickleness; those
of Nejd are distinguished by their stern tenacity and dignity
of deportment; the nations of Yemen are gentle and pliant, but
revengeful; those of Hasa and Oman cheerful and fond of sport,
though at the same time turbulent and unsteady. Anything
approaching to a game is rare in Nejd, and in the Hejaz religion
and the yearly occurrence of the pilgrim ceremonies almost
exclude all public diversions; but in Yemen the well-known
game of the &ldquo;jerid,&rdquo; or palm-stick, with dances and music is
not rare. In Oman such amusements are still more frequent.
Again in Yemen and Oman, coffee-houses, where people resort
for conversation, and where public recitals, songs and other
amusements are indulged in, stand open all day; while nothing
of the sort is tolerated in Nejd. So too the ceremonies of circumcision
or marriage are occasions of gaiety and pastime on the
coast, but not in the central provinces.</p>

<p>An Arab town, or even village, except it be the merest hamlet,
is invariably walled round; but seldom is a stronger material
than dried earth used; the walls are occasionally
flanked by towers of like construction. A dry ditch
<span class="sidenote">Manners and customs.</span>
often surrounds the whole. The streets are irregular
and seldom parallel. The Arab, indeed, lacks an
eye for the straight. The Arab carpenter cannot form a right
angle; an Arab servant cannot place a cloth square on a table.
The Ka&rsquo;ba at Mecca has none of its sides or angles equal. The
houses are of one or two storeys, rarely of three, with flat mud
roofs, little windows and no external ornament. If the town
be large, the expansion of one or two streets becomes a market-place,
where are ranged a few shops of eatables, drugs, coffee,
cottons or other goods. Many of these shops are kept by women.
The chief mosque is always near the market-place; so is also
the governor&rsquo;s residence, which, except in size and in being
more or less fortified Arab fashion, does not differ from a private
house. Drainage is unthought of; but the extreme dryness of
the air obviates the inconvenience and disease that under other
skies could not fail to ensue, and which in the damper climates
of the coast make themselves seriously felt. But the streets are
roughly swept every day, each householder taking care of the
roadway that lies before his own door. Whitewash and colour
are occasionally used in Yemen, Hejaz and Oman; elsewhere a
light ochre tint, the colour of the sun-dried bricks, predominates,
and gives an Arab town the appearance at a distance of a
large dust-heap in the centre of the bright green ring of gardens
and palm-groves. Baked bricks are unknown in Arabia, and
stone buildings are rare, especially in Nejd. Palm branches
and the like, woven in wattles, form the dwellings, of the poorer
classes in the southern districts. Many Arab towns possess
watch-towers, like huge round factory chimneys in appearance,
built of sun-dried bricks, and varying in height from 50 to 100 ft.
or even more. Indeed, two of these constructions at the town
of Birkat-el-Mauj, in Oman, are said to be each of 170 ft. in
height, and that of Nezwah, in the same province, is reckoned
at 140; but these are of stone.</p>

<p>The principal feature in the interior of an Arab house is the
&ldquo;kahwah&rdquo; or coffee-room. It is a large apartment spread with
mats, and sometimes furnished with carpets and a few cushions.
At one end is a small furnace or fireplace for preparing coffee.
In this room the men congregate; here guests are received, and
even lodged; women rarely enter it, except at times when
strangers are unlikely to be present. Some of these apartments
are very spacious and supported by pillars; one wall is usually
built transversely to the compass direction of the Ka&rsquo;ba; it
serves to facilitate the performance of prayer by those who
may happen to be in the kahwah at the appointed times. The
other rooms are ordinarily small.</p>

<p>The Arabs are proverbially hospitable. A stranger&rsquo;s arrival
is often the occasion of an amicable dispute among the wealthier
inhabitants as to who shall have the privilege of receiving him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
Arab cookery is of the simplest. Roughly-ground wheat cooked
with butter; bread in thin cakes, prepared on a heated iron
plate or against the walls of an open oven; a few vegetables,
generally of the leguminous kinds; boiled mutton or camel&rsquo;s
flesh, among the wealthy; dates and fruits&mdash;this is the <i>menu</i>
of an ordinary meal. Rice is eaten by the rich and fish is
common on the coasts. Tea, introduced only a few decades
back, is now largely drunk. A food of which the Arabs are fond
is locusts boiled in salt and water and then dried in the sun.
They taste like stale shrimps, but there is a great sale for them.
Spices are freely employed; butter much too largely for a
European taste.</p>

<p>After eating, the hands are always washed, soap or the ashes
of an alkaline plant being used. A covered censer with burning
incense is then passed round, and each guest perfumes his hands,
face, and sometimes his clothes; this censer serves also on first
receptions and whenever special honour is intended. In Yemen
and Oman scented water often does duty for it. Coffee, without
milk or sugar, but flavoured with an aromatic seed brought from
India, is served to all. This, too, is done on the occasion of a
first welcome, when the cups often make two or three successive
rounds; but, in fact, coffee is made and drunk at any time, as
frequently as the desire for it may suggest itself; and each time
fresh grains are sifted, roasted, pounded and boiled&mdash;a very
laborious process, and one that requires in the better sort of
establishments a special servant or slave for the work. Arabs
generally make but one solid meal a day&mdash;that of supper, soon
after sunset. Even then they do not eat much, gluttony being
rare among them, and even daintiness esteemed disgraceful.
Wine, like other fermented drinks, is prohibited by the Koran,
and is, in fact, very rarely taken, though the inhabitants of the
mountains of Oman are said to indulge in it. On the coast
spirits of the worst quality are sometimes procured; opium
and hashish are sparingly indulged in. On the other hand,
wherever Wahh&#257;biism has left freedom of action, tobacco-smoking
prevails; short pipes of clay, long pipes with large
open bowls, or most frequently the water-pipe or &ldquo;nar-ghileh,&rdquo;
being used. The tobacco smoked is generally strong
and is either brought from the neighbourhood of Bagdad or
grown in the country itself. The strongest quality is that of
Oman; the leaf is broad and coarse, and retains its green colour
even when dried; a few whiffs have been known to produce
absolute stupor. The aversion of the Wahh&#257;bis to tobacco is
well known; they entitle it &ldquo;mukhzi&rdquo; or &ldquo;the shameful,&rdquo;
and its use is punished with blows, as the public use of wine
would be elsewhere.</p>

<p>In dress much variety prevails. The loose cotton drawers
girded at the waist, which in hot climates do duty for trousers,
are not often worn, even by the upper classes, in Nejd
or Yemama, where a kind of silk dressing-gown is
<span class="sidenote">Dress.</span>
thrown over the long shirt; frequently, too, a brown or black
cloak distinguishes the wealthier citizen; his head-dress is a
handkerchief fastened round the head by a band. But in Hejaz,
Yemen and Oman, turbans are by no means uncommon; the
ordinary colour is white; they are worn over one or more skullcaps.
Trousers also form part of the dress in the two former
of these districts; and a voluminous sash, in which a dagger
or an inkstand is stuck, is wrapped round the waist. The poorer
folk, however, and the villagers often content themselves with
a broad piece of cloth round the loins, and another across the
shoulders. In Oman trousers are rare, but over the shirt a long
gown, of peculiar and somewhat close-fitting cut, dyed yellow,
is often worn. The women in these provinces commonly put
on loose drawers and some add veils to their head-dresses;
they are over-fond of ornaments (gold and silver); their hair
is generally arranged in a long plait hanging down behind. All
men allow their beards and moustaches full growth, though
this is usually scanty. Most Arabs shave their heads, and indeed
all, strictly speaking, ought by Mahommedan custom to do so.
An Arab seldom or never dyes his hair. Sandals are worn more
often than shoes; none but the very poorest go barefoot.</p>

<p>Slavery is still, as of old times, a recognized institution throughout
Arabia; and an illicit traffic in blacks is carried on along
the coasts of the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. The
slaves themselves were obtained chiefly from the east
<span class="sidenote">Slavery.</span>
African coast districts down as far as Zanzibar, but this
source of supply was practically closed by the end of the
19th century. Slaves are usually employed in Arabia as
herdsmen or as domestic servants, rarely in agricultural work;
they also form a considerable portion of the bodyguards with
which Eastern greatness loves to surround itself. Like their
countrymen elsewhere, they readily embrace the religion of their
masters and become zealous Mahommedans. Arab custom
enfranchises a slave who has accepted Islam at the end of seven
years of bondage, and when that period has arrived, the master,
instead of exacting from his slave the price of freedom, generally,
on giving him his liberty, adds the requisite means for supporting
himself and a family in comfort. Further, on every important
occasion, such as a birth, circumcision, a marriage or a death,
one or more of the household slaves are sure of acquiring their
freedom. Hence Arabia has a considerable free black population;
and these again, by inter-marriage with the whites
around, have filled the land with a mulatto breed of every shade,
till, in the eastern and southern provinces especially, a white
skin is almost an exception. In Arabia no prejudice exists
against negro alliances; no social or political line separates
the African from the Arab. A negro may become a sheik,
a kadi, an amir, or whatever his industry and his talents may
render him capable of being. This is particularly so in Nejd,
Yemen and Hadramut; in the Hejaz and the north a faint
line of demarcation may be observed between the races.</p>

<p>The Arabs are good soldiers but poor generals. Personal
courage, wonderful endurance of privation, fixity of purpose,
and a contempt of death are qualities common to
almost every race, tribe and clan that compose the
<span class="sidenote">Military qualities.</span>
Arab nation. In skirmishing and harassing they have
few equals, while at close quarters they have often shown themselves
capable of maintaining, armed with swords and spears
alone, a desperate struggle against guns and bayonets, neither
giving nor receiving quarter. Nor are they wholly ignorant
of tactics, their armies, when engaged in regular war, being
divided into centre and wings, with skirmishers in front and a
reserve behind, often screened at the outset of the engagement
by the camels of the expedition. These animals, kneeling and
ranged in long parallel rows, form a sort of entrenchment, from
behind which the soldiers of the main body fire their matchlocks,
while the front divisions, opening out, act on either flank of the
enemy. This arrangement of troops may be traced in Arab
records as far back as the 5th century, and was often exemplified
during the Wahh&#257;bi wars.</p>

<p>Arab women are scarcely less distinguished for their bravery
than the men. Records of armed heroines occur frequently in
the chronicles or myths of the pre-Islamitic time; and in authentic
history the Battle of the Camel, 656 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, where Ayesha, the
wife of Mahomet, headed the charge, is only the first of a number
of instances in which Arab amazons have taken, sword in hand,
no inconsiderable share in the wars and victories of Islam. Even
now it is the custom for an Arab force to be always accompanied
by some courageous maiden, who, mounted on a blackened
camel, leads the onslaught, singing verses of encouragement
for her own, of insult for the opposing tribe. Round her litter
the fiercest of the battle rages, and her capture or death is the
signal of utter rout; it is hers also to head the triumph after the
victory of her clan.</p>

<p>There is little education, in the European sense of the word, in
Arabia. Among the Bedouins there are no schools, and few,
even of the most elementary character, in the towns
or villages. Where they exist, little beyond the
<span class="sidenote">Education.</span>
mechanical reading of the Koran, and the equally mechanical
learning of it by rote, is taught. On the other hand, Arab male-children,
brought up from early years among the grown-up
men of the house or tent, learn more from their own parents
and at home than is common in other countries; reading
and writing are in most instances thus acquired, or rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span>
transmitted; besides such general principles of grammar and
eloquence, often of poetry and history, as the elders themselves
may be able to impart. To this family schooling too are due
the good manners, politeness, and self-restraint that early distinguish
Arab children. In the very few instances where a
public school of a higher class exists, writing, grammar and
rhetoric sum up its teachings. Law and theology, in the narrow
sense that both these words have in the Islamitic system, are
explained in afternoon lectures given in most mosques; and
some verses of the Koran, with one of the accepted commentaries,
that of Baidawi for example, form the basis of the instruction.
Great attention is paid to accuracy of grammar and purity of
diction throughout Arabia; yet something of a dialectic difference
may be observed in the various districts. The purest Arabic,
that which is as nearly as possible identical in the choice of words
and in its inflections with the language of the Koran, is spoken
in Nejd, and the best again of that in the province of Suder.
Next in purity comes the Arabic of Shammar. Throughout the
Hejaz in general, the language, though extremely elegant, is
not equally correct; in el-Hasa, Bahrein and Oman it is decidedly
influenced by the foreign element called Nabataean.
In Yemen, as in other southern districts of the peninsula, Arabic
merges insensibly into the Himyaritic or African dialect of
Hadramut and Mahra. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Semitic Languages</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARACAJÚ,<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> a city and seaport of Brazil, capital of the state
of Sergipe, 170 m. N.N.E. of Bahia, on the river Cotinguiba,
or Cotindiba, 6 m. from the coast. The municipality, of which
it forms a part, had a population in 1890 of 16,336, about two-thirds
of whom lived in the city itself. Aracajú is a badly built
town on the right bank of the river at the base of a ridge of low
sand-hills and has the usual features of an unprogressive provincial
capital. Good limestone is quarried in its vicinity, and
the country tributary to this port produces large quantities of
sugar. Cotton is also grown, and the back country sends down
hides and skins for shipment. The anchorage is good, but a
dangerous bar at the mouth of the river prevents the entrance
of vessels drawing more than 12 ft. The port is visited, therefore,
only by the smaller steamers of the coastwise lines. The
river is navigable as far as the town of Maroim, about 10 m.
beyond Aracajú. The city was founded in 1855.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARACATY,<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Aracatí</span>, a city and port of Brazil, in the state

from the sea. Pop. of the municipality (1890) 20,182, of whom
about 12,000 belonged to the city. A dangerous bar at the
mouth of the river permits the entrance only of the smaller
coasting steamers, but the port is an important commercial
centre, and exports considerable quantities of cotton, hides,
maniçoba, rubber, fruit, and palm wax.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARACHNE,<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> in Greek mythology, the daughter of Idmon of
Colophon in Lydia, a dyer in purple. She had acquired such
skill in the art of weaving that she ventured to challenge Athena.
While the goddess took as subjects her quarrel with Poseidon
as to the naming and possession of Attica, and the warning
examples of those who ventured to pit themselves against the
immortals, Arachne depicted the metamorphoses of the gods
and their amorous adventures. Her work was so perfect that
Athena, enraged at being unable to find any blemish in it, tore
it to pieces. Arachne hanged herself in despair; but the goddess
out of pity loosened the rope, which became a cobweb, while
Arachne herself was changed into a spider (Ovid, <i>Metam</i>. vi.
5-145). The story probably indicates the superiority of Asia
over Greece in the textile arts.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARACHNIDA,<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> the zoological name given in 1815 by Lamarck
(Gr. <span class="grk" title="harachnae">&#7937;&#961;&#940;&#967;&#957;&#951;</span>, a spider) to a class which he instituted for the
reception of the spiders, scorpions and mites, previously classified
by Linnaeus in the order Aptera of his great group Insecta.
Lamarck at the same time founded the class Crustacea for the
lobsters, crabs and water-fleas, also until then included in the
order Aptera of Linnaeus. Lamarck included the Thysanura
and the Myriapoda in his class Arachnida. The Insecta of
Linnaeus was a group exactly equivalent to the Arthropoda
founded a hundred years later by Siebold and Stannius. It was
thus reduced by Lamarck in area, and made to comprise only
the six-legged, wing-bearing &ldquo;Insecta.&rdquo; For these Lamarck
proposed the name Hexapoda; but that name has been little used,
and they have retained to this day the title of the much larger
Linnaean group, viz. Insecta. The position of the Arachnida
in the great sub-phylum Arthropoda, according to recent anatomical
and embryological researches, is explained in the article
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arthropoda</a></span>. The Arachnida form a distinct class or line of
descent in the grade Euarthropoda, diverging (perhaps in
common at the start with the Crustacea) from primitive Euarthropods,
which gave rise also to the separate lines of descent
known as the classes Diplopoda, Crustacea, Chilopoda and
Hexapoda.</p>

<p><i>Limulus an Arachnid.</i>&mdash;Modern views as to the classification
and affinities of the Arachnida have been determined by
the demonstration that <i>Limulus</i> and the extinct Eurypterines
(<i>Pterygotus</i>, &amp;c.) are Arachnida; that is to say, are identical
in the structure and relation of so many important parts with
<i>Scorpio</i>, whilst differing in those respects from other Arthropoda,
that it is impossible to suppose that the identity is due to homoplasy
or convergence, and the conclusion must be accepted that
the resemblances arise from close genetic relationship. The view
that Limulus, the king-crab, is an Arachnid was maintained as
long ago as 1829 by Strauss-Dürckheim (<b>1</b>), on the ground of its
possession of an internal cartilaginous sternum&mdash;also possessed
by the Arachnida (see figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6)&mdash;and of the similarity
of the disposition of the six leg-like appendages around
the mouth in the two cases (see figs. 45 and 63). The evidence
of the exact equivalence of the segmentation and appendages
of Limulus and Scorpio, and of a number of remarkable points
of agreement in structure, was furnished by Ray Lankester in
an article published in 1881 (&ldquo;Limulus an Arachnid,&rdquo; <i>Quart.
Journ. Micr. Sci.</i> vol. xxi. N.S.), and in a series of subsequent
memoirs, in which the structure of the entosternum, of the coxal
glands, of the eyes, of the veno-pericardiac muscles, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>288</span>
respiratory lamellae, and of other parts, was for the first time
described, and in which the new facts discovered were shown
uniformly to support the hypothesis that Limulus is an Arachnid.
A list of these memoirs is given at the close of this article (<b>2, 3,
4, 5</b> and <b>13</b>). The Eurypterines (Gigantostraca) were included
in the identification, although at that time they were supposed
to possess only five pairs of anterior or prosomatic appendages.
They have now been shown to possess six pairs (fig. 47), as do
Limulus and Scorpio.</p>

<p>The various comparisons previously made between the structure
of Limulus and the Eurypterines on the one hand, and that
of a typical Arachnid, such as Scorpio, on the other, had been
vitiated by erroneous notions as to the origin of the nerves
supplying the anterior appendages of Limulus (which were finally
removed by Alphonse Milne-Edwards in his beautiful memoir
(<b>6</b>) on the structure
of that animal), and
secondly by the erroneous
identification of the
double sternal plates
of Limulus, called
&ldquo;chilaria,&rdquo; by Owen,
with a pair of appendages
(<b>7</b>). Once the
identity of the chilaria
with the pentagonal
sternal plate of the
scorpion is recognized&mdash;an
identification first
insisted on by
Lankester&mdash;the whole
series of segments and
appendages in the two
animals, Limulus and
Scorpio, are seen to correspond
most closely,
segment for segment,
with one another (see
figs. 7 and 8). The
structure of the prosomatic
appendages or
legs is also seen to present
many significant
points of agreement
(see figures), but a curious
discrepancy existed
in the six-jointed structure
of the limb in Limulus, which differed from the seven-jointed
limb of Scorpio by the defect of one joint. R.I. Pocock of the
British Museum has observed that in Limulus a marking exists
on the fourth joint, which apparently indicates a previous
division of this segment into two, and thus establishes the agreement
of Limulus and Scorpio in this small feature of the number
of segments in the legs (see fig. 11).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It is not desirable to occupy the limited space of this article by a
full description of the limbs and segments of Limulus and Scorpio.
The reader is referred to the complete series of figures here given,
with their explanatory legends (figs 12, 13, 14, 15). Certain matters,
however, require comment and explanation to render the comparison
intelligible. The tergites, or chitinized dorsal halves of the body
rings, are fused to form a
&ldquo;prosomatic carapace,&rdquo; or
carapace of the prosoma, in
both Limulus and Scorpio
(see figs. 7 and 8). This
region corresponds in both
cases to six somites, as indicated
by the presence of six
pairs of limbs. On the surface
of the carapace there are
in both animals a pair of
central eyes with simple lens
and a pair of lateral eye-tracts,
which in Limulus
consist of closely-aggregated
simple eyes, forming a &ldquo;compound&rdquo;
eye, whilst in
Scorpio they present several
separate small eyes. The
microscopic structure of the
central and the lateral eyes

<p>Following the prosoma is a region consisting of six segments (figs. 14
and 15), each carrying a pair of plate-like
appendages in both Limulus and Scorpio.
This region is called the mesosoma. The
tergites of this region and those of the
following region, the metasoma, are
fused to form a second or posterior
carapace in Limulus, whilst remaining
free in Scorpio. The first pair of foliaceous
appendages in each animal is
the genital operculum; beneath it are
found the openings of the genital ducts.
The second pair of mesosomatic appendages
in Scorpio are known as the
&ldquo;pectens.&rdquo; Each consists of an axis,
bearing numerous blunt tooth-like processes
arranged in a series. This is
represented in Limulus by the first gill-bearing
appendage. The leaves (some
150 in number) of the gill-book (see
figure) correspond to the tooth-like
processes of the pectens of Scorpio.
The next four pairs of appendages (completing
the mesosomatic series of six)
consist, in both Scorpio and Limulus,
of a base carrying each 130 to 150
blood-holding, leaf-like plates, lying on
one another like the leaves of a book. Their minute structure is
closely similar in the two cases; the leaf-like plates receive blood
from the great sternal sinus, and
serve as respiratory organs. The
difference between the gill-books of
Limulus and the lung-books of
Scorpio depends on the fact that the
latter are adapted to aerial respiration,
while the former serve for
aquatic respiration. The appendage
carrying the gill-book stands out on
the surface of the body in Limulus,
and has other portions developed
besides the gill-book and its base;
it is fused with its fellow of the
opposite side. On the other hand, in
Scorpio, the gill-book-bearing appendage
has sunk below the surface,
forming a recess or chamber for
itself, which communicates with the
exterior by an oval or circular
&ldquo;stigma&rdquo; (fig. 10, <i>stg</i>). That this
in-sinking has taken place, and that the lung-books or in-sunken
gill-books of Scorpio really represent appendages (that is to say,
limbs or parapodia) is proved by their developmental history (see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>
figs. 17 and 18). They appear at first as outstanding processes on
the surface of the body.</p>

<p>The exact mode in which the in-sinking of superficial outstanding
limbs, carrying gill-lamellae, has historically taken place has been a
matter of much speculation. It was to be hoped that the specimen
of the Silurian scorpion (<i>Palaeophonus</i>) from Scotland, showing the
ventral surface of the mesosoma (fig. 49), would throw light on this
matter; but the specimen recently carefully studied by the writer
and Pocock reveals neither gill-bearing limbs nor stigmata. The
probability appears to be against an actual introversion of the
appendage and its lamellae, as was at one time suggested by
Lankester. It is probable that such an in-sinking as is shown in the
accompanying diagram has taken place (fig. 15); but we are yet in
need of evidence as to the exact equivalence of margins, axis, &amp;c.,
obtaining between the lung-book of Scorpio and the gill-book of
Limulus. Zoologists are familiar with many instances (fishes,
crustaceans) in which the protective walls of a water-breathing
organ or gill-apparatus become converted into an air-breathing
organ or lung, but there is no other case known of the conversion
of gill processes themselves into air-breathing plates.</p>

<p>The identification of the lung-books of Scorpio with the gill-books
of Limulus is practically settled by the existence of the pectens in
Scorpio (fig. 14, VIII) on the second mesosomatic somite. There is
no doubt that <i>these</i> are parapodial or limb appendages, carrying
numerous imbricated secondary processes, and therefore comparable
in essential structure to the leaf-bearing plates of the second
mesosomatic somite of Limulus. They have remained unenclosed and
projecting on the surface of the body, as once were the appendages
of the four following somites. But they have lost their respiratory
function. In non-aquatic life such an unprotected organ cannot
subserve respiration. The &ldquo;pectens&rdquo; have become more firmly
chitinized and probably somewhat altered in shape as compared
with their condition in the aquatic ancestral scorpions. Their
present function in scorpions is not ascertained. They are not
specially sensitive under ordinary conditions, and may be touched
or even pinched without causing any discomfort to the scorpion.
It is probable that they acquire special sensibility at the breeding
season and serve as &ldquo;guides&rdquo; in copulation. The shape of the legs
and the absence of paired terminal claws in the Silurian <i>Palaeophonus</i>
(see figs. 48 and 49) as compared with living
scorpions (see fig. 10) show that the early
scorpions were aquatic, and we may hope
some day in better-preserved specimens than
the two as yet discovered, to find the respiratory
organs of those creatures in the condition
of projecting appendages serving
aquatic respiration somewhat as in Limulus,
though not necessarily repeating the exact
form of the broad plates of Limulus.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the series of
lamellae of the lung-book and the gill-book
correspond <i>exactly</i> in structure, the narrow,
flat blood-space in the lamellae being interrupted
by pillar-like junctions of the two
surfaces in both cases (see Lankester (<b>4</b>)), and
the free surfaces of the adjacent lamellae being
covered with a very delicate chitinous cuticle
which is drawn out into delicate hairs and
processes. The elongated axis which opens
at the stigma in Scorpio and which can be
cleared of soft, surrounding tissues and coagulated
blood so as to present the appearance
of a limb axis carrying the book-like leaves
of the lung is not really, as it would seem to
be at first sight, the limb axis. That is necessarily
a blood-holding structure and is
obliterated and fused with soft tissues of the
sternal region so that the lamellae cannot be
detached and presented as standing out
from it. The apparent axis or basal support
of the scorpion&rsquo;s lung-books shown in the
figures, is a false or secondary axis and merely
a part of the infolded surface which forms
the air-chamber. The maceration of the soft
parts of a scorpion preserved in weak spirit
and the cleaning of the chitinized in-grown
cuticle give rise to the false appearance of a
limb axis carrying the lamellae. The margins
of the lamellae of the scorpion&rsquo;s lung-book,
which are <i>lowermost</i> in the figures (fig. 15)
and appear to be free, are really those which
are attached to the blood-holding axis. The
true free ends are those nearest the stigma.</p>

<p>Passing on now from the mesosoma we
come in Scorpio to the metasoma of six
segments, the first of which is broad whilst
the rest are cylindrical. The last is perforated
by the anus and carries the post-anal spine
or sting. The somites of the metasoma carry
no parapodia. In Limulus the metasoma is
practically suppressed. In the allied extinct
Eurypterines it is well developed, and resembles
that of Scorpio. In the embryo
Limulus (fig. 42) the six somites of the
mesosoma are not fused to form a carapace
at an early stage, and they are followed by
three separately marked metasomatic somites;
the other three somites of the metasoma have
disappeared in Limulus, but are represented
by the unsegmented prae-anal region. It is
probable that we have in the metasoma of Limulus a case of the disappearance
of once clearly demarcated somites. It would be possible
to suppose, on the other hand, that new somites are only beginning
to make their appearance here. The balance of various considerations
is against the latter hypothesis. Following the metasoma in
Limulus, we have as in Scorpio the post-anal spine&mdash;in this case
not a sting, but a powerful and important organ of locomotion,
serving to turn the animal over when it has fallen upon its
back. The nature of the post-anal spine has been strangely misinterpreted
by some writers. Owen (<b>7</b>) maintained that it represented
a number of coalesced somites, regardless of its post-anal
position and mode of development. The agreement of the grouping
of the somites, of the form of the parapodia (appendages, limbs) in each
region, of the position of the genital aperture and operculum, of the
position and character of the eyes, and of the powerful post-anal spines
not seen in other Arthropods, is very convincing as to the affinity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span>
of Limulus and Scorpio. Perhaps the most important general agreement
of Scorpio compared with Limulus and the Eurypterines is the
division of the body into the three regions (or tagmata)&mdash;prosoma,
mesosoma and metasoma&mdash;each consisting of six segments, the
prosoma having leg-like appendages, the mesosoma having foliaceous
appendages, and the metasoma being destitute of appendages.</p>

<p>In 1893, some years after the identification of the somites of
Limulus with those of Scorpio, thus indicated, had been published,
zoologists were startled by the discovery by a Japanese zoologist,
Kishinouye (<b>8</b>), of a seventh prosomatic somite in the embryo of
Limulus longispina. This was seen in longitudinal sections, as shown
in fig. 19. The simple identification of somite with somite in Limulus
and Scorpio seemed to be threatened by this discovery. But in
1896 Dr August Brauer of Marburg (<b>9</b>) discovered in the embryo
of Scorpio a seventh prosomatic somite (see VII PrG, figs. 17 and 18),
or, if we please so to term it, a <i>praegenital</i> somite, hitherto unrecognized.
In the case of Scorpio this segment is indicated in the embryo
by the presence of a pair of rudimentary appendages, carried by a
well-marked somite. As in Limulus, so in Scorpio, this unexpected
somite and its appendages disappear in the course of development.
In fact, more or less complete &ldquo;excalation&rdquo; of the somite takes place.
Owing to its position it is convenient to term the somite which is
excalated in Limulus and Scorpio &ldquo;the praegenital somite.&rdquo; It
appears not improbable that the sternal plates wedged in between
the last pair of legs in both Scorpio and Limulus, viz. the pentagonal
sternite of Scorpio (fig. 10) and the chilaria of Limulus (see figs. 13
and 20), may in part represent in the adult the sternum of the excalated
praegenital somite. This has not been demonstrated by an
actual following out of the development, but the position of these
pieces and the fact that they are (in Limulus) supplied by an independent
segmental nerve, favours the view that they may comprise
the sternal area of the vanished praegenital somite. This interpretation,
however, of the &ldquo;metasternites&rdquo; of Limulus and Scorpio
is opposed by the coexistence in Thelyphonus (figs. 55, 57 and 58)
of a similar metasternite with a complete praegenital somite. H.J.
Hansen (<b>10</b>) has recognized that the &ldquo;praegenital somite&rdquo; persists
in a rudimentary condition, forming a &ldquo;waist&rdquo; to the series of
somites in the Pedipalpi and Araneae. The present writer is of
opinion that it will be found most convenient to treat this evanescent
somite as something special, and not to attempt to reckon it to
either the prosoma or the mesosoma. These will then remain as
typically composed each of six appendage-bearing somites-the
prosoma comprising in addition the ocular prosthomere.<a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a> When
the praegenital somite or traces of it are present it should not be
called &ldquo;the seventh prosomatic&rdquo; or the &ldquo;first mesosomatic,&rdquo; but
simply the &ldquo;praegenital somite.&rdquo; The first segment of the mesosoma
of Scorpio and Limulus thus remains the first segment, and can
be identified as such throughout the Eu-arachnida, carrying as it
always does the genital apertures. But it is necessary to remember,
in the light of recent discoveries, that the sixth prosomatic pair of
appendages is carried on the seventh somite of the whole series,
there being two prosthomeres or somites in front of the mouth, the
first carrying the eyes, the second the chelicerae; also that the first
mesosomatic or genital somite is not the seventh or even the eighth
of the whole senes of somites which have been historically present,
but is the ninth, owing to the presence or to the excalation of a
praegenital somite. It seems that confusion and trouble will be
best avoided by abstaining
from the introduction of
the non-evident somites,
the ocular and the praegenital,
into the numerical
nomenclature of the component
somites of the three
great body regions. We
shall, therefore, ignoring
the ocular somite, speak of
the first, second, third,
fourth, fifth and sixth leg-bearing
somites of the prosoma,
and indicate the
appendages by the Roman
numerals, I, II, III, IV,
V, VI, and whilst ignoring
the praegenital somite we
shall speak of the first,
second, third, &amp;c., somite of
the mesosoma or opisthosoma
(united mesosoma and
metasoma) and indicate
them by the Arabic
numerals.</p>

<p>There are a number of
other important points of
structure besides those referring
to the somites and
appendages in which
Limulus agrees with Scorpio
or other Arachnida and
differs from other Arthropoda.
The chief of these
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>The Composition of the
Head</i> (that is to say, of the
anterior part of the prosoma)
<i>with especial Reference
to the Region in Front of the
Mouth.</i>&mdash;It appears (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arthropoda</a></span>) that there is
embryological evidence of
the existence of two somites
in Arachnida which were
originally post-oral, but
have become prae-oral by
adaptational shifting of the
oral aperture. These
forwardly-slipped somites
are called &ldquo;prosthomeres.&rdquo;
The first of these has, in
Arachnids as in other
Arthropods, its pair of appendages
represented by
the eyes. The second has
for its pair of appendages
the small pair of limbs
which in all living Arachnids is either chelate or retrovert (as in
spiders), and is known as the chelicerae. It is possible, as maintained
by some writers (Patten and others), that the lobes of the cerebral
nervous mass in Arachnids
indicate a larger
number of prosthomeres
as having fused in this
region, but there is no
<i>embryological</i> evidence at
present which justifies us
in assuming the existence
in Arachnids of more than
two prosthomeres. The
position of the chelicerae
of Limulus and of the
ganglionic nerve-masses
from which they receive
their nerve-supply, is
closely similar to that of
the same structures in
Scorpio. The cerebral
mass is in Limulus more
easily separated by dissection
as a median lobe
distinct from the laterally-placed
ganglia of the chelceral somite than is the case in Scorpio, but
the relations are practically the same in the two forms. Formerly
it was supposed that in Limulus both the chelicerae and the next
following pair of appendages were prosthomerous, as in Crustacea,
but the dissections of Alphonse Milne-Edwards (<b>6</b>) demonstrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
the true limitations of the cerebrum, whilst embryological researches
have done as much for Scorpio. Limulus thus agrees with Scorpio
and differs from the Crustacea, in which there are three prosthomeres&mdash;one
ocular and two carrying palpiform appendages. It is true that in
the lower Crustacea (Apus, &amp;c.) we have evidence of the
gradual movement forward of the nerve-ganglia belonging to these
palpiform appendages. But although in such lower Crustacea the
nerve-ganglia of the third prosthomere have not fused with the
anterior nerve-mass, there is no question as to the prae-oral position
of two appendage-bearing somites in addition to the ocular prosthomere.
The Crustacea have, in fact, three prosthomeres in the head and the
Arachnida only two, and Limulus agrees with the Arachnida
in this respect and differs from the Crustacea. The central nervous
systems of Limulus and of Scorpio present closer agreement in
structure than can be found when a Crustacean is compared with
either. The wide divarication of the lateral cords in the prosoma
and their connexion by transverse commissures, together with the
&ldquo;attraction&rdquo; of ganglia to the prosomatic ganglion group which
properly belong to hinder segments, are very nearly identical in the
two animals. The form and disposition of the ganglion cells are also
peculiar and closely similar in the two. (See Patten (<b>42</b>) for important
observations on the neuromeres, &amp;c., of Limulus and Scorpio.)</p>

<p>2. <i>The Minute Structure of the Central Eyes and of the Lateral
Eyes.</i>&mdash;Limulus agrees with Scorpio not only in having a pair of
central eyes and also lateral eyes, but in the microscopic structure
of those organs, which differs in the central and lateral eyes
respectively. The central eyes are &ldquo;simple eyes,&rdquo; that is to say,
have a single lens, and are hence called &ldquo;monomeniscous.&rdquo; The
lateral eyes are in Limulus &ldquo;compound eyes,&rdquo; that is to say, consist
of many lenses placed close together; beneath each lens is a complex
of protoplasmic cells, in which the optic nerve terminates. Each
such unit is termed an &ldquo;ommatidium.&rdquo; The lateral eyes of Scorpio
consist of groups of separate small lenses each with its ommatidium,
but they do not form a continuous compound eye as in Limulus. The ommatidium
(soft structure beneath the lens-unit of a compound eye) is very
simple in both Scorpio and Limulus. It consists of a single layer
of cells, continuous with those which secrete the general chitinous
covering of the prosoma. The cells of the ommatidium are a good
deal larger than the neighbouring common cells of the epidermis.
They secrete the knob-like lens (fig. 22). But they also receive the
nerve fibres of the optic nerve. They are at the same time both
optic nerve-end cells, that is to say, retina cells, and corneagen cells or
secretors of the chitinous lens-like cornea. In Limulus (fig. 23) each
ommatidium has a peculiar ganglion cell developed in a central position,
whilst the ommatidium of the lateral eyelets of Scorpio shows small
intermediate cells between the larger nerve-end cells. The
structure of the lateral eye of Limulus was first described by
Grenacher, and further and more accurately by Lankester and
Bourne (<b>5</b>) and by Watase; that of Scorpio by Lankester and Bourne,
who showed that the statements of von Graber were erroneous, and
that the lateral eyes of Scorpio
have a single cell-layered or &ldquo;monostichous&rdquo; ommatidium like that
of Limulus. Watase has shown, in a very convincing way, how by
deepening the pit-like set of cells beneath a simple lens the
more complex ommatidia of the compound eyes of Crustacea and Hexapoda may
be derived from such a condition as that presented in the lateral
eyes of Limulus and Scorpio. (For details the reader is referred
to Watase (<b>11</b>) and to Lankester and Bourne (<b>5</b>).) The structure of
the central eyes of Scorpio and spiders and also of Limulus differs
essentially from that of the lateral eyes in having two layers
of cells (hence called diplostichous) beneath the lens, separated
from one another by a membrane (figs. 24 and 25). The upper layer is the
corneagen and secretes the lens, the lower is the retinal layer. The
mass of soft cell-structures beneath a large lens of a central eye is
called an &ldquo;ommatoeum.&rdquo; It shows in Scorpio and Limulus a
tendency to segregate into minor groups or &ldquo;ommatidia.&rdquo; It is
found that in embryological growth the retinal layer of the central
eyes forms as a separate pouch, which is pushed in laterally beneath
the corneagen layer from the epidermic cell layer. Hence it is in
origin double, and consists of a true retinal layer and a post-retinal
layer (fig. 24, B), though these are not separated by a membrane.
Accordingly the diplostichous ommatoeum or soft tissue of the
Arachnid&rsquo;s central eye should strictly be called &ldquo;triplostichous,&rdquo;
since the deep layer is itself doubled or folded. The retinal cells of
both the lateral and central eyes of Limulus and Scorpio produce
cuticular structures on their sides; each such piece is a rhabdomere
and a number (five or ten) uniting form a rhabdom (fig. 26). In
the specialized ommatidia of the compound eyes of Crustacea and
Hexapods the rhabdom is an important structure.<a name="fa2m" id="fa2m" href="#ft2m"><span class="sp">2</span></a> It is a very significant fact
that the lateral and central eyes of Limulus and Scorpio not
only agree each with each in regard to their monostichous and
diplostichous structure, but also in the formation in both
classes of eyes of rhabdomeres and rhabdoms in which the
component pieces are five or a multiple of five (fig. 26).
Whilst each unit of the lateral eye of Limulus has a rhabdom of ten<a name="fa3m" id="fa3m" href="#ft3m"><span class="sp">3</span></a> pieces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
forming a star-like chitinous centre in section, each lateral eye of
Scorpio has several rhabdoms of five or less rhabdomeres, indicating
that the Limulus lateral eye-unit is more specialized than the detached
lateral eyelet of Scorpio, so as to present a coincidence of one lens
with one rhabdom. Numerous rhabdomeres (grouped as rhabdoms in
Limulus) are found in the retinal layer of the central eyes also.</p>

<p>Whilst Limulus agrees thus closely with Scorpio in regard to the
eyes, it is to be noted that no Crustacean has structures corresponding
to the peculiar diplostichous central eyes, though these
occur again (with differences in detail) in <i>Hexapoda</i>. Possibly,
however, an investigation of the development of the median eyes of
some Crustacea (Apus, Palaemon) may prove them to be diplostichous
in origin.</p>

<p>3. <i>The so-called</i> &ldquo;<i>Coxal Glands</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;In 1882 (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc</i>.
No. 221) Lankester described under the name &ldquo;coxal
glands&rdquo; a pair of brilliantly white oviform bodies lying in
the Scorpion&rsquo;s prosoma immediately above the coxae of
the fifth and sixth pairs of legs (fig. 27). These bodies
had been erroneously supposed by Newport (<b>12</b>) and
other observers to be glandular outgrowths of the alimentary
canal. They are really excretory glands, and
communicate with the exterior by a very minute aperture
on the posterior face of the coxa of the fifth limb on each
side. When examined with the microscope, by means of
the usual section method, they are seen to consist of a
labyrinthine tube lined with peculiar cells, each cell having
a deep vertically striated border on the surface farthest
from the lumen, as is seen in the cells of some renal organs.
The coils and branches of the tube are packed by connective
tissue and blood spaces. A similar pair of coxal glands,
lobate instead of ovoid in shape, was described by
Lankester in Mygale, and it was also shown by him that
the structures in Limulus called &ldquo;brick-red glands&rdquo; by
Packard have the same structure and position as the coxal
glands of Scorpio and Mygale. In Limulus these organs
consist each of four horizontal lobes lying on the coxal
margin of the second, third, fourth, and fifth prosomatic
limbs, the four lobes being connected to one another by
a transverse piece or stem (fig. 28). Microscopically their
structure is the same in essentials as that of the coxal
glands of Scorpio (<b>13</b>). Coxal glands have since been
recognized and described in other Arachnida. In 1900 it
was shown that the coxal gland of Limulus is provided
with a very delicate thin-walled coiled duct which opens,
even in the adult condition, by a minute pore on
the coxa of the fifth leg (Patten and Hazen, <b><span class="scs">13A</span></b>).
Previously to this, Lankester&rsquo;s pupil Gulland had shown (1885) that
in the embryo the coxal gland is a comparatively simple tube,
which opens to the exterior in this position and by its other extremity
into a coelomic space. Similar observations were made by Laurie
(<b>17</b>) in Lankester&rsquo;s laboratory (1890) with regard to the early
condition of the coxal gland of Scorpio, and by Bertkau (<b>41</b>) as to
that of the spider Atypus. H.M. Bernard (<b><span class="scs">13B</span></b>) showed that the
opening remains in the adult scorpion. In all the embryonic or
permanent opening is on the coxa of the fifth pair of prosomatic
limbs. Thus an organ newly discovered in Scorpio was found to
have its counterpart in Limulus.</p>

<p>The name &ldquo;coxal gland&rdquo; needs to be carefully distinguished
from &ldquo;crural gland,&rdquo; with which it is apt to be confused. The crural
glands, which occur in many terrestrial Arthropods, are epidermal
in origin and totally distinct from the coxal glands. The
coxal glands of the Arachnida are structures of the same
nature as the green glands of the higher Crustacea and
the so-called &ldquo;shell glands&rdquo; of the Entomostraca. The
latter open at the base of the fifth pair of limbs of the
Crustacean, just as the coxal glands open on the coxal
joint of the fifth pair of limbs of the Arachnid. Both
belong to the category of &ldquo;coelomoducts,&rdquo; namely,
tubular or funnel-like portions of the coelom opening to
the exterior in pairs in each somite (potentially,) and
usually persisting in only a few somites as either &ldquo;urocoels&rdquo;
(renal organs) or &ldquo;gonocoets&rdquo; (genital tubes). In Peripatus
they occur in every somite of the body. They have till
recently been very generally identified with the nephridia
of Chaetopod worms, but there is good reason for considering
the true nephridia (typified by the nephridia
of the earthworm) as a distinct class of organs (see
Lankester in vol. ii. chap. in. of <i>A Treatise on Zoology</i>,
1900). The genital ducts of Arthropoda are, like the
green glands, shell glands and coxal glands, to be regarded
as coelomoducts (gonocoels). The coxal glands
do not establish any special connexion between Limulus
and Scorpio, since <span class="correction" title="amended from thay">they</span> also occur in the same somite
in the lower Crustacea, but it is to be noted that the
coxal glands of Limulus are in minute structure and
probably in function more like those of Arachnids than
those of Crustacea.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Entosternites and their Minute Structure.</i>&mdash;Strauss-Dürckheim
(<b>1</b>) was the first to insist on the affinity
between Limulus and the Arachnids, indicated by the
presence of a free suspended entosternum or plastron
or entosternite in both. We have figured here (figs. 1 to
6) the entosternites of Limulus, Scorpio and Mygale.
Lankester some years ago made a special study of the
histology (<b>3</b>) of these entosternites for the purpose of
comparison, and also ascertained the relations of the
very numerous muscles which are inserted into them
(<b>4</b>). The entosternites are cartilaginous in texture, but they
have neither the chemical character nor the microscopic structure
of the hyaline cartilage of Vertebrates. They yield chitin in
place of chondrin or gelatin&mdash;as does also the cartilage of
the Cephalopod&rsquo;s endoskeleton. In microscopic structure they all
present the closest agreement with one another. We find a firm,
homogeneous or sparsely fibrillated matrix in which are embedded
nucleated cells (corpuscles of protoplasm) arranged in rows of three,
six or eight, parallel with the adjacent lines of fibrillation.</p>

<p>A minute entosternite having the above-described structure is
found in the Crustacean Apus between the bases of the mandibles,
and also in the Decapoda in a similar position, but in no Crustacean
does it attain to any size or importance. On the other hand, the
entosternite of the Arachnida is a very large and important feature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
in the structure of the prosoma, and must play an important part
in the economy of these organisms. In Limulus (figs. 1 and 2) it
has as many as twenty-five pairs of muscles attached to it, coming
to it from the bases of the surrounding limbs and from the dorsal
carapace and from the pharynx. It consists of an oblong plate 2 in.
in length and 1 in breadth, with a pair of tendinous outgrowths
standing out from it at right angles on each side. It &ldquo;floats&rdquo;
between the prosomatic nerve
centres and the alimentary
canal. In each somite of the
mesosoma is a small, free entosternite
having a similar position,
but below or ventral to
the nerve cords, and having a
smaller number of muscles
attached to it. The entosternite
was probably in origin
part of the fibrous connective
tissue lying close to the integument
of the sternal surface&mdash;giving attachment to muscles
corresponding more or less to
those at present attached to
it. It became isolated and
detached, why or with what
advantage to the organism it
is difficult to say, and at that
period of Arachnidan development
the great ventral nerve
cords occupied a more lateral
position than they do at
present. We know that such
a lateral position of the nerve
cords preceded the median
position in both Arthropoda
and Chaetopoda. Subsequently
to the floating off of
the entosternite the approximation
of the nerve cords took
place in the prosoma, and thus
they were able to take up a
position below the entosternite.
In the mesosoma the approximation
had occurred before the
entosternites were formed.</p>

<p>In the scorpion (figs. 3 and 4)
the entosternite has tough
membrane-like outgrowths
which connect it with the
body-wall, both dorsally and
ventrally forming an oblique
diaphragm, cutting off the
cavity of the prosoma from
that of the mesosoma. It was
described by Newport as &ldquo;the
diaphragm.&rdquo; Only the central
and horizontal parts of this structure correspond precisely to the entosternite
of Limulus: the right and left anterior processes (marked <i>ap</i> in
figs. 3 and 4, and RAP, LAP, in figs. 1 and 2) correspond in the two
animals, and the median lateral process <i>lmp</i> of the scorpion represents
the tendinous outgrowths ALR, PLR of Limulus. The scorpion&rsquo;s
entosternite gives rise to outgrowths, besides the great posterior
flaps, <i>pf</i>, which form the diaphragm, unrepresented in Limulus.
These are a ventral arch forming a neural canal through which the
great nerve cords pass (figs. 3 and 4, <i>snp</i>), and further a dorsal
gastric canal and arterial canal which transmit the alimentary tract
and the dorsal artery respectively (figs. 3 and 4, GC, DR).</p>

<p>In Limulus small entosternites are found in each somite of the
appendage-bearing mesosoma, and we
find in Scorpio, in the only somite of
the mesosoma which has a well-developed
pair of appendages, that of
the pectens, a small entosternite with
ten pairs of muscles inserted into it.
The supra-pectinal entosternite lies
ventral to the nerve cords.</p>

<p>In Mygale (figs. 5 and 6) the form
of the entosternite is more like that
of Limulus than is that of Scorpio.
The anterior notch Ph.N. is similar
to that in Limulus, whilst the imbricate
triangular pieces of the posterior
median region resemble the similarly-placed
structures of Limulus in a
striking manner.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that we are
singularly ignorant as to the functional
significance of these remarkable organs&mdash;the
entosternites. Their movement
in an upward or downward direction
in Limulus and Mygale must exert a
pumping action on the blood contained
in the dorsal arteries and the
ventral veins respectively. In Scorpio
the completion of the horizontal plate by oblique naps, so as to form
an actual diaphragm shutting off the cavity of the prosoma from the
rest of the body, possibly gives to the organs contained in the
anterior chamber a physiological
advantage in respect of the supply
of arterial blood and its separation
from the venous blood of the
mesosoma. Possibly the movement
of the diaphragm may
determine the passage of air into
or out of the lung-sacs. Muscular
fibres connected with the suctorial
pharynx are in Limulus inserted
into the entosternite, and the
activity of the two organs may be
correlated.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Blood and the Blood-vascular
System.</i>&mdash;The blood fluids
of Limulus and Scorpio are very
similar. Not only are the blood
corpuscles of Limulus more like
in form and granulation to those
of Scorpio than to those of any
Crustacean, but the fluid is in
both animals strongly impregnated
with the blue-coloured
respiratory proteid, haemocyanin.
This body occurs also in the blood
of Crustacea and of Molluscs, but
its abundance in both Limulus
and Scorpio is very marked, and
gives to the freshly-shed blood a
strong indigo-blue tint.</p>

<p>The great dorsal contractile vessel or &ldquo;heart&rdquo; of Limulus is
closely similar to that of Scorpio; its ostia or incurrent orifices are
placed in the same somites as those of Scorpio, but there is one
additional posterior pair. The origin of the paired arteries from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>294</span>
heart differs in Limulus from the arrangement obtaining in Scorpio,
in that a pair of lateral commissural arteries exist in Limulus (as
described by Alphonse Milne-Edwards (<b>6</b>)) leading to a suppression
of the more primitive direct connexion of the four pairs of posterior
lateral arteries and of the great median posterior arteries with the
heart itself (fig. 29). The arterial system is very completely developed
in both Limulus and Scorpio, branching repeatedly until minute
arterioles are formed, not to be distinguished from true capillaries;
these open into irregular swollen vessels which are the veins or
venous sinuses. A very remarkable feature in Limulus, first described
by Owen, is the close accompaniment of the prosomatic nerve centres
and nerves by arteries, so close indeed that the great ganglion mass
and its out-running nerves are actually sunk in or invested by
arteries. The connexion is not so intimate in Scorpio, but is nevertheless
a very close one, closer than we find in any other Arthropods
in which the arterial system is well developed, <i>e.g.</i> the Myriapoda
and some of the arthrostracous Crustacea. It seems that there is a
primitive tendency in the Arthropoda for the arteries to accompany
the nerve cords, and a &ldquo;supra-spinal&rdquo; artery&mdash;that is to say, an
artery in close relation to the ventral nerve cords&mdash;has been described
in several cases. On the other hand, in many Arthropods, especially
those which possess tracheae, the arteries do not have a long course,
but soon open into wide blood sinuses. Scorpio certainly comes
nearer to Limulus in the high development of its arterial system,
and the intimate relation of the anterior aorta and its branches
to the nerve centres and great nerves, than does any other Arthropod.</p>

<p>An arrangement of great functional importance in regard to the
venous system must now be described, which was shown in 1883 by
Lankester to be common to Limulus and Scorpio. This arrangement
has not hitherto been detected in any other class than the Arachnida,
and if it should ultimately prove to be peculiar to that group, would
have considerable weight as a proof of the close genetic affinity of
Limulus and Scorpio.</p>

<p>The great pericardial sinus is strongly developed in both animals.
Its walls are fibrous and complete, and it holds a considerable volume
of blood when the heart itself is contracted. Opening in pairs in
each somite, right and left into the pericardial sinus are large veins,
which bring the blood respectively from the gill-books and the lung-books
to that chamber, whence it passes by the ostia into the heart.
The blood is brought to the respiratory organs in both cases by a
great venous collecting sinus having a ventral median position. In
both animals <i>the wall of the pericardial sinus is connected by vertical
muscular bands to the wall of the ventral venous sinus</i> (its lateral expansions
around the lung-books in Scorpio) in each somite through
which the pericardium passes. There are seven pairs of these <i>veno-pericardiac
vertical muscles</i> in Scorpio, and eight in Limulus (see
figs. 30, 31, 32). It is obvious that the contraction of these muscles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span>
must cause a depression of the floor of the pericardium and a rising
of the roof of the ventral blood sinus, and a consequent increase of
volume and flow of blood to each. Whether the pericardium and
the ventral sinus are made to expand simultaneously or all the movement
is made by one only of the surfaces concerned, must depend
on conditions of tension. In any case it is clear that we have in
these muscles an apparatus for causing the blood to flow differentially
in increased volume into either the pericardium, through the veins
leading from the respiratory organs, or from the body generally into
the great sinuses which bring the blood to the respiratory organs.
These muscles act so as to pump the blood through the respiratory
organs.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that with so highly developed an arterial
system Limulus and Scorpio should have a highly developed mechanism
for determining the flow of blood to the respiratory organs.
That this is, so to speak, a need of animals with localized respiratory
organs is seen by the existence of provisions serving a similar purpose
in other animals, <i>e.g.</i> the branchial hearts of the Cephalopoda.</p>

<p>The veno-pericardiac muscles of Scorpio were seen and figured by
Newport but not described by him. Those of Limulus were described
and figured by Alphonse Milne-Edwards, but he called them merely
&ldquo;transparent ligaments,&rdquo; and did not discover their muscular
structure. They are figured and their importance for the first time
recognized in the memoir on the muscular and skeletal systems of
Limulus and Scorpio by Lankester, Beck and Bourne (<b>4</b>).</p>

<p>6. <i>Alimentary Canal and Gastric Glands.</i>&mdash;The alimentary canal in
Scorpio, as in Limulus, is provided with a powerful suctorial pharynx,
in the working of which extrinsic muscles take a part. The mouth
is relatively smaller in Scorpio than in Limulus&mdash;in fact is minute,
as it is in all the terrestrial Arachnida which suck the juices of
either animals or plants. In both, the alimentary canal takes a
straight course from the pharynx (which bends under it downwards
and backwards towards the mouth in Limulus) to the anus, and is
a simple, narrow, cylindrical tube (fig. 33). The only point in which
the gut of Limulus resembles that of Scorpio rather than that of
any of the Crustacea, is in possessing more than a single pair of ducts
or lateral outgrowths connected with ramified gastric glands or
gastric caeca. Limulus has two pairs of these, Scorpio as many as
six pairs. The Crustacea never have more than one pair. The
minute microscopic structure of the gastric glands in the two animals
is practically identical. The functions of these gastric diverticula
have never been carefully investigated. It is very probable that in
Scorpio they do not serve merely to secrete a digestive fluid (shown
in other Arthropoda to resemble the pancreatic fluid), but that they
also become distended by the juices of the prey sucked in by the
scorpion&mdash;as certainly must occur in the case of the simple unbranched
gastric caeca of the spiders.</p>

<p>The most important difference which exists between the structure
of Limulus and that of Scorpio is found in the hinder region of the
alimentary canal. Scorpio is here provided with a single or double
pair of renal excretory tubes, which have been identified by earlier
authors with the Malpighian tubes of the Hexapod and Myriapod
insects. Limulus is devoid of any such tubes. We shall revert to
this subject below.</p>

<p class="pt2">7. <i>Ovaries and Spermaries: Gonocoels and Gonoducts.</i>&mdash;The
scorpion is remarkable for having the specialized portion of coelom
from the walls of which egg-cells or sperm-cells are developed
according to sex, in the form of a simple but extensive network.
It is not a pair of simple tubes, nor of dendriform tubes, but a closed
network. The same fact is true of Limulus, as was shown by Owen (<b>7</b>)
in regard to the ovary, and by Benham (<b>14</b>) in regard to the testis.
This is a very definite and remarkable agreement, since such a
reticular gonocoel is not found in Crustacea (except in the male
Apus). Moreover, there is a significant agreement in the character
of the spermatozoa of Limulus and Scorpio. The Crustacea are&mdash;with
the exception of the Cirrhipedia&mdash;remarkable for having stiff,
motionless spermatozoids. In Limulus Lankester found (<b>15</b>) the
spermatozoa to possess active flagelliform &ldquo;tails,&rdquo; and to resemble
very closely those of Scorpio which, as are those of most terrestrial
Arthropoda, are actively motile. This is a microscopic point of
agreement, but is none the less significant.</p>

<p>In regard to the important structures concerned with the fertilization
of the egg, Limulus and Scorpio differ entirely from one another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span>
The eggs of Limulus are fertilized in the sea after they have been
laid. Scorpio, being a terrestrial animal, fertilizes by copulation.
The male possesses elaborate copulatory structures of a chitinous
nature, and the eggs are fertilized in the female without even quitting
the place where they are formed on the wall of the reticular gonocoel.
The female scorpion is viviparous, and the young are produced in a
highly developed condition as fully formed scorpions.</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Differences between Limulus and Scorpio.</i>&mdash;We have now passed in
review the principal structural features in which Limulus agrees
with Scorpio and differs from other Arthropoda. There remains for
consideration the one important structural difference between the
two animals. Limulus agrees with the majority of the Crustacea in
being destitute of renal excretory caeca or tubes opening into the
hinder part of the gut. Scorpio, on the other hand, in common
with all air-breathing Arthropoda except Peripatus, possesses these
tubules, which are often called Malpighian tubes. A great deal has
been made of this difference by some writers. It has been considered
by them as proving that Limulus, in spite of all its special agreements
with Scorpio (which, however, have scarcely been appreciated by the
writers in question), really belongs to the Crustacean line of descent,
whilst Scorpio, by possessing Malpighian tubes, is declared to be
unmistakably tied together with the other Arachnida to the tracheate
Arthropods, the Hexapods, Diplopods, and Chilopods, which all
possess Malpighian tubes.</p>

<p class="pt2">It must be pointed out that the presence or absence of such renal
excretory tubes opening into the intestine appears to be a question
of adaptation to the changed physiological conditions of respiration,
and not of morphological significance, since a pair of renal excretory
tubes of this nature is found in certain Amphipod Crustacea (Talorchestia,
&amp;c.) which have abandoned a purely aquatic life. This view
has been accepted and supported by Professors Korschelt and Heider
(<b>16</b>). An important fact in its favour was discovered by Laurie (<b>17</b>),
who investigated the embryology of two species of Scorpio under
Lankester&rsquo;s direction. It appears that the Malpighian tubes of
Scorpio are developed from the mesenteron, viz. that portion of the
gut which is formed by the hypoblast, whereas in Hexapod insects
the similar caecal tubes are developed from the proctodaeum or
in-pushed portion of the gut which is formed from epiblast. In fact
it is not possible to maintain that the renal excretory tubes of the
gut are of one common origin in the Arthropoda. They have
appeared independently in connexion with a change in the excretion
of nitrogenous waste in Arachnids, Crustacea, and the other classes
of Arthropoda when aerial, as opposed to aquatic, respiration has
been established&mdash;and they have been formed in some cases from
the mesenteron, in other cases from the proctodaeum. Their
appearance in the air-breathing Arachnids does not separate those
forms from the water-breathing Arachnids which are devoid of them,
any more than does their appearance in certain Amphipoda separate
those Crustaceans from the other members of the class.</p>

<p>Further, it is pointed out by Korschelt and Heider that the hinder
portion of the gut frequently acts in Arthropoda as an organ of
nitrogenous excretion in the absence of any special excretory tubules,
and that the production of such caeca from its surface in separate
lines of descent does not involve any elaborate or unlikely process of
growth. In other words, the Malpighian tubes of the terrestrial
Arachnida are <i>homoplastic</i> with those of Hexapoda and Myriapoda,
and not <i>homogenetic</i> with them. We are compelled to take a similar
view of the agreement between the tracheal air-tubes of Arachnida
and other tracheate Arthropods. They are homoplasts (see <b>18</b>) one
of another, and do not owe their existence in the various classes
compared to a common inheritance of an ancestral tracheal system.</p>

<p><i>Conclusions arising from the Close Affinity of Limulus and
Scorpio.</i>&mdash;When we consider the relationships of the various
classes of Arthropoda, having
accepted and established the
fact of the close genetic affinity
of Limulus and Scorpio, we are
led to important conclusions.
In such a consideration we have
to make use not only of the fact
just mentioned, but of three important
generalizations which
serve as it were as implements
for the proper estimation of the
relationships of any series of
organic forms. First of all there
is the generalization that the
relationships of the various
forms of animals (or of plants)
to one another is that of the
ultimate twigs of a much-branching
genealogical tree. Secondly,
identity of structure in two organisms
does not necessarily
indicate that the identical
structure has been inherited from
an ancestor common to the two
organisms compared (homogeny),
but may be due to
independent development of a
like structure in two different
lines of descent (homoplasy).
Thirdly, those members of a
group which, whilst exhibiting
undoubted structural characters
indicative of their proper assignment
to that group, yet are
simpler than and inferior in
elaboration of their organization
to other members of the group,
are not necessarily representatives
of the earlier and primitive
phases in the development of
the group&mdash;but are very often
examples of retrogressive change
or degeneration. The second
and third implements of analysis
above cited are of the nature of
cautions or checks. Agreements
are not <i>necessarily</i> due to
common inheritance; simplicity is not <i>necessarily</i> primitive and
ancestral.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we must not rashly set down agreements
as due to &ldquo;homoplasy&rdquo; or &ldquo;convergence of development&rdquo; if
we find two or three or more concurrent agreements. The probability
is against agreement being due to homoplasy when the
agreement involves a number of really separate (not correlated)
coincidences. Whilst the chances are in favour of some <i>one</i>
homoplastic coincidence or structural agreement occurring
between some member or other of a large group <i>a</i> and some
member or other of a large group <i>b</i>, the matter is very different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>297</span>
when by such an initial coincidence the two members have been
particularized. The chances against these two selected members
exhibiting <i>another</i> really independent homoplastic agreement
are enormous: let us say 10,000 to 1. The chances against yet
another coincidence are a hundred million to one, and against
yet one more &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo; they are the square of a hundred
million to one. Homoplasy can only be assumed when the coincidence
is of a simple nature, and is such as may be reasonably
supposed to have arisen by the action of like selective conditions
upon like material in two separate lines of descent.<a name="fa4m" id="fa4m" href="#ft4m"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>So, too, degeneration is not to be lightly assumed as the explanation
of a simplicity of structure. There is a very definite
criterion of the simplicity due to degeneration, which can in
most cases be applied. Degenerative simplicity is never uniformly
distributed over all the structures of the organism. It
affects many or nearly all the structures of the body, but leaves
some, it may be only one, at a high level of elaboration and
complexity. Ancestral simplicity is more uniform, and does
not co-exist with specialization and elaboration of a single organ.
Further: degeneration cannot be inferred safely by the examination
of an isolated case; usually we obtain a series of forms
indicating the steps of a change in structure&mdash;and what we have
to decide is whether the movement has been from the simple
to the more complex, or from the more complex to the simple.
The feathers of a peacock afford a convenient example of primitive
and degenerative simplicity. The highest point of elaboration
in colour, pattern and form is shown by the great eye-painted
tail feathers. From these we can pass by gradual transitions
in two directions, viz. either to the simple lateral tail feathers
with a few rami only, developed only on one side of the shaft
and of uniform metallic coloration&mdash;or to the simple contour
feathers of small size, with the usual symmetrical series of
numerous rami right and left of the shaft and no remarkable
colouring. The one-sided specialization and the peculiar metallic
colouring of the lateral tail feathers mark them as the extreme
terms of a degenerative series, whilst the symmetry, likeness of
constituent parts <i>inter se</i>, and absence of specialized pigment,
as well as the fact that they differ little from any average feather
of birds in general, mark the contour feather as primitively
simple, and as the starting-point from which the highly elaborated
eye-painted tail feather has gradually evolved.</p>

<p>Applying these principles to the consideration of the Arachnida,
we arrive at the conclusion that the smaller and simpler
Arachnids are not the more primitive, but that the Acari or mites
are, in fact, a degenerate group. This was maintained by
Lankester in 1878 (<b>19</b>), again in 1881 (<b>20</b>); it was subsequently
announced as a novelty by Claus in 1885 (<b>21</b>). Though the
aquatic members of a class of animals are in some instances
derived from terrestrial forms, the usual transition is from an
aquatic ancestry to more recent land-living forms. There is no
doubt, from a consideration of the facts of structure, that the
aquatic water-breathing Arachnids, represented in the past by
the Eurypterines and to-day by the sole survivor Limulus, have
preceded the terrestrial air-breathing forms of that group.
Hence we see at once that the better-known Arachnida form
a series, leading from Limulus-like aquatic creatures through
scorpions, spiders and harvest-men, to the degenerate Acari or
mites. The spiders are specialized and reduced in apparent
complexity, as compared with the scorpions, but they cannot be
regarded as degenerate since the concentration of structure
which occurs in them results in greater efficiency and power than
are exhibited by the scorpion. The determination of the relative
degree of perfection of organization attained by two animals
compared is difficult when we introduce, as seems inevitable,
the question of efficiency and power, and do not confine the
question to the perfection of morphological development. We
have no measure of the degree of power manifested by various
animals&mdash;though it would be possible to arrive at some conclusions
as to how that &ldquo;power&rdquo; should be estimated. It is not
possible here to discuss that matter further. We must be content
to point out that it seems that the spiders, the pedipalps, and
other large Arachnids have not been derived from the scorpions
directly, but have independently developed from aquatic
ancestors, and from one of these independent groups&mdash;probably
through the harvest-men from the spiders&mdash;the Acari have finally
resulted.</p>

<p class="pt2">Leaving that question for consideration in connexion with
the systematic statement of the characters of the various groups
of Arachnida which follows on p. 299, it is well now to consider
the following question, viz., seeing that Limulus and Scorpio are
such highly developed and specialized forms, and that they seem
to constitute as it were the first and second steps in the series of
recognized Arachnida&mdash;what do we know, or what are we led to
suppose with regard to the more primitive Arachnida from which
the Eurypterines and Limulus and Scorpio have sprung? Do
we know in the recent or fossil condition any such primitive
Arachnids? Such a question is not only legitimate, but
prompted by the analogy of at least one other great class of
Arthropods. The great Arthropod class, the Crustacea, presents
to the zoologist at the present day an immense range of forms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>298</span>
comprising the primitive phyllopods, the minute copepods, the
parasitic cirrhipedes and the powerful crabs and lobsters, and
the highly elaborated sand-hoppers and slaters. It has been
insisted, by those who accepted Lankester&rsquo;s original doctrine
of the direct or genetic affinity of the Chaetopoda and Arthropoda,
that Apus and Branchipus really come very near to the
ancestral forms which connected those two great branches of
Appendiculate (Parapodiate) animals. On the other hand, the
land crabs are at an immense distance from these simple forms.
The record of the Crustacean family-tree
is, in fact, a fairly complete
one&mdash;the lower primitive members
of the group are still represented
by living forms in great abundance.
In the case of the Arachnida, if we
have to start their genealogical
history with Limulus and Scorpio,
we are much in the same position
as we should be in dealing with
the Crustacea, were the whole of the
Entomostraca and the whole of the
Arthrostraca wiped out of existence
and record.  There is no possibility
of doubt that the series of forms
corresponding in the Arachnidan
line of descent, to the forms distinguished
in the Crustacean line
of descent as the lower grade&mdash;the
Entomostraca&mdash;have ceased to
exist, and not only so, but have
left little evidence in the form of
fossils as to their former existence
and nature. It must, however, be
admitted as probable that we should
find some evidence, in ancient rocks
or in the deep sea, of the early more
primitive Arachnids. And it must
be remembered that such forms
must be expected to exhibit, when
found, differences from Limulus and
Scorpio as great as those which
separate Apus and Cancer. The
existing Arachnida, like the higher
Crustacea, are &ldquo;nomomeristic,&rdquo;
that is to say, have a fixed typical
number of somites to the body.
Further, they are like the higher
Crustacea, &ldquo;somatotagmic,&rdquo; that is
to say, they have this limited set of
somites grouped in three (or more)
&ldquo;tagmata&rdquo; or regions of a fixed
number of similarly modified somites&mdash;each
tagma differing in the modification
of its fixed number of somites
from that characterizing a neighbouring
&ldquo;tagma.&rdquo;  The most
primitive among the lower Crustacea,
on the other hand, for
example, the Phyllopoda, have
not a fixed number of somites, some genera&mdash;even allied
species&mdash;have more, some less, within wide limits; they are &ldquo;anomomeristic.&rdquo; They also, as is generally the case
with anomomeristic animals, do not exhibit any conformity
to a fixed plan of &ldquo;tagmatism&rdquo; or division of the
somites of the body into regions sharply marked off from one
another; the head or prosomatic tagma is followed by a trunk consisting of somites which either graduate in character as we
pass along the series or exhibit a large variety in different genera, families and orders, of grouping of the somites. They are
anomotagmic, as well as anomomeristic.</p>

<p>When it is admitted&mdash;as seems to be reasonable&mdash;that the
primitive Arachnida would, like the primitive Crustacea, be
anomomeristic and anomotagmic, we shall not demand of
claimants for the rank of primitive Arachnids agreement with
Limulus and Scorpio in respect of the exact number of their
somites and the exact grouping of those somites; and when
we see how diverse are the modifications of the branches of
the appendages both in Arachnida and in other classes of
Arthropoda (<i>q.v.</i>), we shall not over-estimate a difference
in the form of this or that appendage exhibited by the claimant as compared with
the higher Arachnids. With those considerations in mind, the
claim of the extinct group of the trilobites to be considered
as representatives of the lower and more primitive steps in the
Arachnidan genealogy must, it seems, receive a favourable
judgment. They differ from the Crustacea in that they have only
a single pair of prae-oral appendages, the second pair being
definitely developed as mandibles. This fact renders their
association with the Crustacea impossible, if classification is
to be the expression of genetic affinity inferred from structural
coincidence. On the contrary, this particular point is one in
which they agree with the higher Arachnida. But little is known
of the structure of these extinct animals; we are therefore
compelled to deal with such special points of resemblance and
difference as their remains still exhibit. They had lateral eyes<a name="fa5m" id="fa5m" href="#ft5m"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
which resemble no known eyes so closely as the lateral eyes of
Limulus. The general form and structure of their prosomatic
carapace are in many striking features identical with that of
Limulus. The trilobation of the head and body&mdash;due to the
expansion and flattening of the sides or &ldquo;pleura&rdquo; of the tegumentary
skeleton&mdash;is so closely repeated in the young of Limulus
that the latter has been called &ldquo;the trilobite stage&rdquo; of Limulus
(fig. 42 compared with fig. 41). No Crustacean exhibits this
trilobite form. But most important of the evidences presented
by the trilobites of affinity with Limulus, and therefore with the
Arachnida, is the tendency less marked in some, strongly carried
out in others, to form a pygidial or telsonic shield&mdash;a fusion of
the posterior somites of the body, which is precisely identical
in character with the metasomatic carapace of Limulus. When
to this is added the fact that a post-anal spine is developed to
a large size in some trilobites (fig. 38), like that of Limulus and
Scorpio, and that lateral spines on the pleura of the somites are
frequent as in Limulus, and that neither metasomatic fusion
of somites nor post-anal spine, nor lateral pleural spines are
found in any Crustacean, nor all three together in any Arthropod
besides the trilobites and Limulus&mdash;the claim of the trilobites
to be considered as representing one order of a lower grade
of Arachnida, comparable to the grade Entomostraca of the
Crustacea, seems to be established.</p>

<p>The fact that the single pair of prae-oral appendages of
trilobites, known only as yet in one genus, is in that particular
case a pair of uni-ramose antennae&mdash;does not render the association
of trilobites and Arachnids improbable. Although the
prae-oral pair of appendages in the higher Arachnida is usually
chelate, it is not always so; in spiders it is not so; nor in many Acari.
The bi-ramose structure of the post-oral limbs, demonstrated by
Beecher in the trilobite Triarthrus, is no more inconsistent with
its claim to be a primitive Arachnid than is the foliaceous
modification of the limbs in Phyllopods inconsistent with
their relationship to the Arthrostracous Crustaceans such as
Gammarus and Oniscus.</p>

<p>Thus, then, it seems that we have in the trilobites the representatives
of the lower phases of the Arachnidan pedigree. The
simple anomomeristic trilobite, with its equi-formal somites
and equi-formal appendages, is one term of the series which
ends in the even more simple but degenerate Acari. Between the
two and at the highest point of the arc, so far as morphological
differentiation is concerned, stands the scorpion; near to it in
the trilobite&rsquo;s direction (that is, on the ascending side) are
Limulus and the Eurypterines&mdash;with a long gap, due to obliteration
of the record, separating them from the trilobite. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>299</span>
other side&mdash;tending downwards from the scorpion towards the
Acari&mdash;are the Pedipalpi, the spiders, the book-scorpions, the
harvest-men and the water-mites.</p>

<p>The strange nobody-crabs or Pycnogonids occupy a place on
the ascending half of the arc below the Eurypterines and Limulus.
They are strangely modified and degenerate, but seem to be (as
explained in the systematic review) the remnant of an Arachnidan
group holding the same relation to the scorpions which the
Laemodipoda hold to the Podophthalmate Crustacea.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Class</span>. ARACHNIDA.&mdash;Euarthropoda having two prosthomeres
(somites which have passed from a post-oral to a prae-oral
position), the appendages of the first represented by eyes,
of the second by solitary rami which are rarely antenniform,
more usually chelate. A tendency is exhibited to the formation
of a metasomatic as well as a prosomatic carapace by fusion
of the tergal surfaces of the somites. Intermediate somites
forming a mesosoma occur, but tend to fuse superficially with
the metasomatic carapace or to become co-ordinated with the
somites of the metasoma, whether fused or distinct to form
one region, the opisthosoma (abdomen of authors). In the most
highly developed forms the two anterior divisions (tagmata)
of the body, prosoma and mesosoma, each exhibit six pairs of
limbs, pediform and plate-like respectively, whilst the metasoma
consists of six limbless somites and a post-anal spine. The genital
apertures are placed in the first somite following the prosoma,
excepting where a praegenital somite, usually suppressed, is retained.
Little is known of the form of the appendages in the lowest archaic
Arachnida, but the tendency of those of the prosomatic somites has
been (as in the Crustacea) to pass from a generalized bi-ramose or
multi-ramose form to that of uni-ramose antennae, chelae and walking legs.</p>

<p>The Arachnida are divisible into two grades of structure&mdash;according
to the fixity or non-fixity of the number of somites building up
the body:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Grade A</i> (<i>of the Arachnida</i>). <i>ANOMOMERISTICA.</i>&mdash;Extinct
archaic Arachnida, in which (as in the Entomostracous Crustacea)
the number of well-developed somites may be more or less than
eighteen and may be grouped only as head (prosoma) and trunk or
may be further differentiated. A telsonic tergal shield of greater
or less size is always present, which may be imperfectly divided into
well-marked but immovable tergites indicating incompletely differentiated
somites. The single pair of palpiform appendages in front
of the mouth has been found in one instance to be antenniform,
whilst the numerous post-oral appendages in the same genus were
bi-ramose. The position of the genital apertures is not known.
Compound lateral eyes present; median eyes wanting. The body
and head have the two pleural regions of each somite flattened and
expanded on either side of the true gut-holding body-axis. Hence
the name of the sub-class signifying tri-lobed, a condition realized
also in the Xiphosurous Arachnids. The members of this group,
whilst resembling the lower Crustacea (as all lower groups of a
branching genealogical tree must do), differ from them essentially
in that the head exhibits only one prosthomere (in addition to the
eye-bearing prosthomere) with palpiform appendages (as in all
Arachnida) instead of two. The Anomomeristic Arachnida form a
single sub-class, of which only imperfect fossil remains are known.</p>

<p><b>Sub-class (of the Anomomeristica). TRILOBITAE.</b>&mdash;The single
sub-class Trilobitae constitutes the grade Anomomeristica. It has
been variously divided into orders by a number of writers. The
greater or less evolution and specialization of the metasomatic
carapace appears to be the most important basis for classification&mdash;but
this has not been made use of in the latest attempts at drawing
up a system of the Trilobites. The form of the middle and lateral
regions of the prosomatic shield has been used, and an excessive
importance attached to the demarcation of certain areas in that
structure. Sutures are stated to mark off some of these pieces, but
in the proper sense of that term as applied to the skeletal structures
of the Vertebrata, no sutures exist in the chitinous cuticle of Arthropoda.
That any partial fusion of originally distinct chitinous
plates takes place in the cephalic shield of Trilobites, comparable
to the partial fusion of bony pieces by suture in Vertebrata, is a
suggestion contrary to fact.</p>

<p>The Trilobites are known only as fossils, mostly Silurian and
prae-Silurian; a few are found in Carboniferous and Permian strata.
As many as two thousand species are known. Genera with small
metasomatic carapace, consisting of three to six fused segments
distinctly marked though not separated by soft membrane, are
<i>Harpes</i>, <i>Paradoxides</i> and <i>Triarthrus</i> (fig. 34). In <i>Calymene</i>, <i>Homalonotus</i>
and <i>Phacops</i> (fig. 38) from six to sixteen segments are clearly
marked by ridges and grooves in the metasomatic tagma, whilst in
<i>Illaenus</i> the shield so formed is large but no somites are marked out
on its surface. In this genus ten free somites (mesosoma) occur
between the prosomatic and metasomatic carapaces. <i>Asaphus</i>
and <i>Megalaspis</i> (fig. 39) are similarly constituted. In <i>Agnostus</i>
(fig. 40) the anterior and posterior carapaces constitute almost the
entire body, the two carapaces being connected by a mid-region of
only two free somites. It has been held that the forms with a small
number of somites marked in the posterior carapace and numerous
free somites between the anterior and posterior carapace, must be
considered as anterior to those in which a great number of posterior
somites are traceable in the metasomatic carapace, and that those
in which the traces of distinct somites in the posterior or metasomatic
carapace are most completely absent must be regarded as
derived from those in which somites are well marked in the posterior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>
carapace and similar in appearance to the free somites. The genus
<i>Agnostus</i>, which belongs to the last category, occurs abundantly in Cambrian strata and is
one of the earliest forms
known. This would
lead to the supposition
that the great development
of metasomatic
carapace is a primitive
and not a late character,
were it not for the fact
that <i>Paradoxides</i> and
<i>Atops</i>, with an inconspicuous
telsonic carapace
and numerous free
somites, are also Cambrian
in age, the latter
indeed anterior in
horizon to <i>Agnostus</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand,
it may well be doubted
whether the pygidial or
posterior carapace is
primarily due to a fusion
of the tergites of somites
which were previously
movable and well developed.
The posterior
carapace of the Trilobites
and of <i>Limulus</i> is
probably enough in
origin a telsonic carapace&mdash;that
is to say, is
the tergum of the last
segment of the body
which carries the anus.
From the front of this
region new segments are
produced in the first
instance, and are added
during growth to the
existing series. This
telson may enlarge, it
may possibly even become
internally and
sternally developed as
partially separate somites,
and the tergum
may remain without
trace of somite formation,
or, as appears to
be the case in <i>Limulus</i>,
the telson gives rise to
a few well-marked somites
(mesosoma and two
others) and then enlarges
without further
trace of segmentation,
whilst the chitinous
integument which develops
in increasing
thickness on the terga
as growth advances
welds together the unsegmented
telson and
the somites in front of
it, which were previously
marked by
separate tergal thickenings.
It must always be
remembered that we are
liable (especially in the
case of fossilized integuments)
to attach an
unwarranted interpretation
to the mere
discontinuity or continuity
of the thickened
plates of chitinous
cuticle on the back of
an Arthropod. These
plates may fuse, and yet
the somites to which
they belong may remain
distinct, and each have
its pair of appendages
well developed. On the other hand, an unusually large tergal plate,
whether terminal or in the series, is not always due to fusion
of the dorsal plates of once-separate somites, but is often a case
of growth and enlargement of a single somite without formation
of any trace of a new somite. For the literature of Trilobites see
(<b>22*</b>).</p>

the prosomatic series (which with its ocular prosthomere and palpiform
limbs [Pantopoda], would thus consist of eight somites), but
to have been gradually reduced. In living Arachnids, excepting
the Pantopoda, it is either fused (with loss of its appendages) with
the prosoma (<i>Limulus</i>,<a name="fa7m" id="fa7m" href="#ft7m"><span class="sp">7</span></a> <i>Scorpio</i>), after embryonic appearance, or is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>301</span>
retained as a rudimentary, separate, detached somite in front of the
mesosoma, or disappears altogether (excalation). The atrophy
and total disappearance of ancestrally well-marked somites frequently
take place (as in all Arthropoda) at the posterior extremity
of the body, whilst excalation of somites may occur at the constricted
areas which often separate adjacent &ldquo;regions,&rdquo; though there are
very few instances in
which it has been recognized.
Concentration of
the organ-systems by
fusion of neighbouring
regions (prosoma, mesosoma,
metasoma), previously
distinct, has
frequently occurred,
together with obliteration
of the muscular
and chitinous structures
indicative of distinct
somites. This concentration
and obliteration of
somites, often accompanied
by dislocation
of important segmental
structures (such as appendages
and nerve-ganglia),
may lead to
highly developed specialization
(individuation,
H. Spencer), as in the
Araneae and Opiliones,
and, on the other hand,
may terminate in simplification
and degeneration,
as in the Acari.</p>

<p class="pt2">The most important
general change which
has affected the structure
of the nomomeristic
Arachnida in the course
of their historic development
is the transition
from an aquatic to a
terrestrial life. This has
been accompanied by
the conversion of the
lamelliform gill-plates into lamelliform lung-plates, and later the
development from the lung-chambers, and at independent sites,
of tracheae or air-tubes (by adaptation of the vasifactive tissue of
the blood-vessels) similar to those independently developed in
<i>Peripatus</i>, Diplopoda, Hexapoda and Chilopoda. Probably tracheae
have developed independently by the same process in several groups
of tracheate Arachnids. The nomomeristic Arachnids comprise two
sub-classes&mdash;one a very small degenerate offshoot from early ancestors;
the other, the great bulk of the class.</p>

<p><b>Sub-Class I. (of the Nomomeristica). PANTOPODA.</b>&mdash;Nomomeristic
Arachnids, in which the somites corresponding to mesosoma
and metasoma have entirely aborted. The seventh, and sometimes
the eighth, leg-bearing somite is present and has its leg-like
appendages fully developed. Monomeniscous eyes with a double (really
triple) cell-layer formed by invagination, as in the Eu-arachnida,
are present The Pantopoda stand in the same relation to <i>Limulus</i>
and <i>Scorpio</i> that <i>Cyamus</i> holds to the thoracostracous Crustacea.
The reduction of the organism to seven leg-bearing somites, of which
the first pair, as in so many Eu-arachnida, are chelate, is a form of
degeneration connected with a peculiar quasi-parasitic habit resembling
that of the crustacean Laemodipoda. The genital pores
are situate at the base of the 7th pair of limbs, and may be repeated
on the 4th, 5th, and 6th. In all known Pantopoda the size of the
body is quite minute as compared with that of the limbs: the alimentary
canal sends a long caecum into each leg (cf. the Araneae)
and the genital products are developed in gonocoels also placed in
the legs.</p>

<p class="pt2">The Pantopoda are divided into three orders, the characters of
which are dependent on variation in the presence of the full number
of legs.</p>

<p><b>Order 1. (of the Pantopoda). Nymphonomorpha,</b> Pocock (nov.)
(fig. 43).&mdash;In primitive forms belonging to the family <i>Nymphonidae</i>
the full complement of appendages is retained&mdash;the 1st (mandibular),
the 2nd (palpiform), and the 3rd (ovigerous) pairs being well developed in both sexes. In certain derivative forms constituting
the family <i>Pallenidae</i>, however, the appendages of the 2nd pair
are either rudimentary or atrophied altogether.</p>

<p>Two families: 1. Nymphonidae (genus <i>Nymphon</i>), and 2. Pallenidae
(genus <i>Pallene</i>).</p>

<p><b>Order 2. Ascorhynchomorpha,</b> Pocock (nov.).&mdash;Appendages of
the 2nd and 3rd pairs retained and developed, as in the more primitive
types of Nymphonomorpha; but those of the 1st pair are either
rudimentary, as in the <i>Ascorhynchidae</i>, or atrophied, as in the
<i>Colossendeidae</i>. In the latter a further specialization is shown in
the fusion of the body segments.</p>

<p>Two families. 1. Ascorhynchidae (genera <i>Ascorhynchus</i> and
<i>Ammothea</i>); 2. Colossendeidae (genera <i>Colossendeis</i> and <i>Discoarachne</i>).</p>

<p><b>Order 3. Pycnogonomorpha,</b> Pocock (nov.).&mdash;Derivative forms in
which the reduction in number of the anterior appendages is carried
farther than in the other orders, reaching its extreme in the <i>Pycnogonidae</i>,
where the 1st and 2nd pairs are absent in both sexes, and the 3rd pair
also are absent in the female. In the <i>Hannoniidae</i>,
however, which resemble the <i>Pycnogonidae</i> in the absence of the
3rd pair in the female and of the 2nd pair in both sexes, the 1st pair
are retained in both sexes.</p>

<p>Two families: 1. Hannoniidae (genus <i>Hannonia</i>); 2. Pycnogonidae
(genera <i>Pycnogonum</i> and <i>Phoxichilus</i>).</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The Pantopoda are not known in the fossil condition.
They are entirely marine, and are not uncommon in the coralline
zone of the sea-coast. The species are few, not more than fifty (23).
Some large species of peculiar genera are taken at great depths.
Their movements are extremely sluggish. They are especially
remarkable for the small size of the body and the extension of
viscera into the legs. Their structure is eminently that of degenerate
forms. Many frequent growths of coralline Algae and hydroid
polyps, upon the juices of which they feed, and in some cases a
species of gall is produced in hydroids by the penetration of the
larval Pantopod into the tissues of the polyp.</p>

<p><b>Sub-Class II. (of the Nomomeristic Arachnida). EU-ARACHNIDA.</b>&mdash;These
start from highly developed and specialized aquatic
branchiferous forms, exhibiting a prosoma with six pediform pairs of
appendages, an intermediate prae-genital somite, a mesosoma of six
somites bearing lamelliform pairs of appendages, and a metasoma
of six somites devoid of appendages, and the last provided with
a post-anal spine. Median eyes are present, which are monomeniscous,
with distinct retinal and corneagenous cell-layers, and
placed centrally on the prosoma. Lateral eyes also may be
present, arranged in lateral groups, and having a single or double
cell-layer beneath the lens. The first pair of limbs is often
chelate or prehensile, rarely antenniform; whilst the second, third
and fourth may also be chelate, or may be simple palps or walking
legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span></p>

<p>An internal skeletal plate, the so-called &ldquo;entosternite&rdquo; of fibro-cartilaginous
tissue, to which many muscles are attached, is placed
between the nerve-cords and the alimentary tract in the prosoma
of the larger forms (<i>Limulus</i>, <i>Scorpio</i>, <i>Mygale</i>). In the same and
other leading forms a pair of much-coiled glandular tubes, the coxal
glands (coelomocoels in origin), is found with a duct opening on the
coxa of the fifth pair of appendages of the prosoma. The vascular
system is highly developed (in the non-degenerate forms); large
arterial branches closely accompany or envelop the chief nerves;
capillaries are well developed. The blood-corpuscles are large amoebiform
cells, and the blood-plasma is coloured blue by haemocyanin.</p>

<p>The alimentary canal is uncoiled and cylindrical, and gives rise
laterally to large gastric glands, which are more than a single pair
in number (two to six pairs), and may assume the form of simple
caeca. The mouth is minute and the pharynx is always suctorial,
never gizzard-like. The gonadial tubes (gonocoels or gonadial
coelom) are originally reticular and paired, though they may be
reduced to a simpler condition. They open on the first somite of
the mesosoma. In the numerous degenerate forms simplification
occurs by obliteration of the demarcations of somites and the
fusion of body-regions, together with a gradual suppression of the
lamelliferous respiratory organs and the substitution for them of
tracheae, which, in their turn, in the smaller and most reduced
members of the group, may also disappear.</p>

<p>The Eu-arachnida are divided into two grades with reference to
the condition of the respiratory organs as adapted to aquatic or
terrestrial life.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">Grade <i>a</i> (of the Eu-arachnida). <span class="sc">delobranchia</span>
(Hydropheustea).</p>

<p>Mesosomatic segments furnished with large plate-like appendages,
the 1st pair acting as the genital operculum, the remaining pairs
being provided with branchial lamellae fitted for breathing oxygen
dissolved in water. The prae-genital somite partially or wholly
obliterated in the adult. The mouth lying far back, so that the
basal segments of all the prosomatic appendages, excepting those
of the 1st pair, are capable of acting as masticatory organs. Lateral
eyes consisting of a densely packed group of eye-units (&ldquo;compound&rdquo;
eyes).</p>

<p><b>ORDER 1. XIPHOSURA.</b>&mdash;The prae-genital somite fuses in the
embryo with the prosoma and disappears (see fig. 19). Not
free-swimming,
none of the prosomatic appendages modified to act as
paddles; segments of the mesosoma and metasoma (= opisthosoma)
not more than ten in number, distinct or coalesced.</p>

<i>Limulus</i> (figs. 44 and 45; also figs. 7, 9, 11, to 15 and 20), often
termed the king-crab, which occurs on the American coast of the
Atlantic Ocean, but not on its eastern coasts, and on the Asiatic coast
of the Pacific. The Atlantic species (<i>L. polyphemus</i>) is common on
the coasts of the United States, and is known as the king-crab or
horse-shoe crab. A single specimen was found in the harbour of
Copenhagen in the 18th century, having presumably been carried
over by a ship to which it clung.</p>

<p>A species of <i>Limulus</i> is found in the Buntersandstein of the

intermediate between <i>Limulus</i> and the Trilobitae. The young form
of <i>Limulus</i> itself (fig. 40) is also similar to a Trilobite so far as its

<p class="pt2"><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The Gigantostraca are frequently spoken of as &ldquo;the

became extinct in Palaeozoic times, and are chiefly found in the
Upper Silurian, though extending upwards as far as the Carboniferous.
They may be regarded as &ldquo;macrourous&rdquo; Xiphosura; that
is to say, Xiphosura in which the nomomeristic number of eighteen
well-developed somites is present and the posterior ones form a long
tail-like region of the body. There still appears to be some doubt
whether in the sub-order Eurypteromorpha the first pair of prosomatic
appendages (fig. 46) is atrophied, or whether, if present, it has
the form of a pair of tactile palps or of minute chelae. Though there
are indications of lamelliform respiratory appendages on mesosomatic
somites following that bearing the genital operculum, we
cannot be said to have any proper knowledge as to such appendages,
and further evidence with regard to them is much to be desired.

breathe atmospheric oxygen, forming the leaves of the so-called
lung-books. In specialized forms these pulmonary sacs are wholly
or partly replaced by tracheal tubes. The appendages of the mesosoma
generally suppressed; in the more primitive forms one or two
pairs may be retained as organs subservient to reproduction or silk-spinning.

the only two invertebrates which had impressed the minds of early
men sufficiently to be raised to the dignity of astronomical representation.
It is all the more remarkable that the scorpion proves to be
the oldest animal form of high elaboration which has persisted to
the present day. In the Upper Silurian two specimens of a scorpion
have been found (figs. 48, 49), one in Gothland and one in Scotland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>304</span>
which would be recognized at once as true scorpions by a child or a
savage. The Silurian scorpion <i>Palaeophonus</i>, differs, so far as obvious
points are concerned, from a modern scorpion only in the thickness
of its legs and in their terminating in strong spike-like joints, instead
of being slight and provided with a pair of terminal claws. The legs
of the modern scorpion (fig. 10; fig. 51) are those of a terrestrial
Arthropod, such as a beetle; whilst those of the Silurian scorpion
are the legs of an aquatic Arthropod, such as a crab or lobster. It
is probable that the Silurian scorpion was an aquatic animal, and
that its respiratory lamellae were still projecting from the surface
of the body to serve as branchiae. No trace of &ldquo;stigmata,&rdquo; the
orifices of the lung-chambers of modern scorpions, can be found in
the Scottish specimen of <i>Palaeophonus</i>, which presents the ventral
surface of the animal to view. On the other hand, no trace of respiratory
appendages excepting the pectens can be detected in the
specimen (see fig. 49).</p>

<p>Fossil scorpions of the modern type are found in the Coal Measures.
At the present day scorpions of various genera are found in all the
warm regions of the world. In Europe they occur as far north as
Bavaria and the south of France. The largest species measure 9 in.
from the front of the head to the end of the sting, and occur in
tropical India and Africa. Between 200 and 300 species are known.
The scorpions use their large chelae for seizing prey and for fighting
with one another. They never use the sting when (as frequently
happens) they attack another scorpion, because, as was ascertained
by A.G. Bourne (<b>24</b>), the poison exuded by the sting has no injurious
effect on another scorpion nor on the scorpion itself. The
stories of a scorpion stinging itself to death when placed in a circle
of burning coals are due to erroneous observation. When placed in
such a position the scorpion faints and becomes inert. It is found
(Bourne, <b>24</b>) that some species of scorpion faint at a temperature
of 40° Cent. They recover on being removed to cooler conditions.
A scorpion having seized its prey (usually a large insect, or small
reptile or mammal) with the large chelae brings its tail over its head,
and deliberately punctures the struggling victim twice with its sting
(fig. 52). The poison of the sting is similar to snake-poison
(Calmette), and rapidly paralyses animals which are not immune
to it. It is probably only sickly adults or young children of the
human race who can be actually killed by a scorpion&rsquo;s sting. When
the scorpion has paralysed its prey in this way, the two short chelicerae
are brought into play (fig. 53). By the crushing action of their
pincers, and an alternate backward and forward movement, they
bring the soft blood-holding tissues of the victim close to the
minute pin-hole aperture which is the scorpion&rsquo;s mouth. The
muscles acting on the bulb-like pharynx now set up a pumping
action (see Huxley, <b>26</b>); and the juices&mdash;but no solid
matter, excepting such as is reduced to
powder&mdash;are sucked into the scorpion&rsquo;s
alimentary canal. A scorpion appears to
prefer for its food another scorpion, and
will suck out the juices of an individual as
large as itself. When this has taken
place, the gorged scorpion becomes
distended and tense in the mesosomatic
region. It is certain that the absorbed
juices do not occupy the alimentary
canal alone, but pass also into its caecal
off-sets which are the ducts of the
gastric glands (see fig. 33).</p>

<p>All Arachnida, including <i>Limulus</i>, feed by suctorial action in
essentially the same way as <i>Scorpio</i>.</p>

<p>Scorpions of various species have been observed to make a hissing
noise when disturbed, or even when not disturbed. The sound is
produced by stridulating organs developed on the basal joints of
the limbs, which differ in position and character in different genera
(see Pocock, <b>27</b>). Scorpions copulate with the ventral surfaces in
contact. The eggs are fertilized, practically in the ovary, and develop
<i>in situ</i>. The young are born fully formed and are carried by
the mother on her back. As many as thirty have been counted in
a brood. For information as to the embryology of scorpions, the
reader is referred to the works named in the bibliography below.
Scorpions do not possess spinning organs nor form either snares or
nests, so far as is known. But some species inhabiting sandy deserts
form extensive burrows. The fifth pair of prosomatic appendages
is used by these scorpions when burrowing, to kick back the sand as
the burrow is excavated by the great chelae.</p>

<p>References to works dealing with the taxonomy and geographical
distribution of scorpions are given at the end of this article (<b>28</b>).</p>

<p>Section &beta;. <i>Epectinata.</i>&mdash;The primitive distinction between the
mesosoma and the metasoma wholly or almost wholly obliterated,
the two regions uniting to form an opisthosoma, which never consists
of more than twelve somites and never bears appendages or breathing-organs
behind the 4th somite. The breathing-organs of the
opisthosoma, when present, represented by two pairs of stigmata,
opening either upon the 1st and 2nd (Pedipalpi) or the 2nd and 3rd
somites (Solifugae, Pseudo-scorpiones), or by a single pair upon the
3rd (? 2nd) somite (Opiliones) of the opisthosoma, there being rarely
an additional stigma on the 4th (some Solifugae). The appendages
of the 2nd somite of the opisthosoma absent, rarely minute and bud-like
(some Amblypygi), never pectiniform. A prae-genital somite
is often present either in a reduced condition forming a waist (Pedipalpi,
Araneae, Palpigradi) or as a full-sized tergal plate (Pseudo-scorpiones);
in some it is entirely atrophied (Solifugae, Holosomata,
and Rhynchostomi). Lateral eyes when present diplostichous.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The Epectinate Arachnids do not stand so close to the
aquatic ancestors of the Embolobranchia as do the Pectiniferous
scorpions. At the same time we are not justified in supposing that
the scorpions stand in any way as an intermediate grade between
any of the existing Epectinata and the Delobranchia. It is probable
that the Pedipalpi, Araneae, and Podogona have been separately
evolved as distinct lines of descent from the ancient aquatic Arachnida.
The Holosomata and Rhynchostomi are probably offshoots
from the stem of the Araneae, and it is not unlikely (in view of the
structure of the prosomatic somites of the Tartarides) that the
Solifugae are connected in origin with the Pedipalpi. The appearance
of tracheae in place of lung-sacs cannot be regarded as a starting-point
for a new line of descent comprising all the tracheate forms;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span>
tracheae seem to have developed independently in different lines of
descent. On the whole, the Epectinata are highly specialized and
degenerate forms, though there are few, if any, animals which
surpass the spiders in rapidity of movement, deadliness of attack
and constructive instincts.</p>

<p><i>Remarks on the Araneae.</i>&mdash;The Spiders are the most numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>307</span>
and diversified group of the Arachnida; about 2000 species are
known. No noteworthy fossil spiders are known; the best-preserved
are in amber of Oligocene age. <i>Protolycosa</i> and <i>Arthrolycosa</i>
occur in the Carboniferous. Morphologically, the spiders are remarkable
for the concentration and specialization of their structure,
which is accompanied with high physiological efficiency. The larger
species of Bird&rsquo;s Nest Spiders (<i>Avicularia</i>), the opisthosoma of which
is as large as a bantam&rsquo;s egg, undoubtedly attack young birds, and
M&rsquo;Cook gives an account of the capture in its web by an ordinary
house spider of a small mouse. The &ldquo;retrovert&rdquo; or bent-back
first pair of appendages is provided with a poison gland opening on
the fang or terminal segment. Spiders form at least two kinds of
constructions&mdash;snares for the capture of prey and nests for the
preservation of the young. The latter are only formed by the female,
which is a larger and more powerful animal than the male. Like
the scorpions the spiders have a special tendency to cannibalism,
and accordingly the male, in approaching the female for the purpose
of fertilizing her, is liable to be fallen upon and sucked dry by the
object of his attentions. The sperm is removed by the male from
the genital aperture into a special receptacle on the terminal segment
of the 2nd prosomatic appendage. Thus held out at some distance
from the body, it is cautiously advanced by the male spider to the
genital aperture of the female.</p>

<p><i>Galeodes</i> has been made the means of a comparison between the
structure of the Arachnida and Hexapod insects by Haeckel and
other writers, and it was at one time suggested that there was a
genetic affinity between the two groups&mdash;through <i>Galeodes</i>, or
extinct forms similar to it. The segmentation of the prosoma and
the form of the appendages bear a homoplastic similarity to the
head, pro-, meso-, and meta-thorax of a Hexapod with mandibles,
maxillary palps and three pairs of walking legs; while the opisthosoma
agrees in form and number of somites with the abdomen of
a Hexapod, and the tracheal stigmata present certain agreements
in the two cases. Reference to literature (<b>36</b>).</p>

remarkable group has reference to the position of the male intromittent
organ (fig. 73, <span class="scs">E</span>). They are small degenerate animals
with a relatively firm integument. Not more than four species and
twice that number of specimens are known. They have been found
in West Africa and South America. A fact of special interest in
regard to them is that the genus Poliochera, from the Coal Measures,
appears to be a member of the same group. The name Cryptostemma,
given to the first-known genus of the order, described by
Guérin-Méneville, refers to the supposed
concealment of the eyes by the movable
cephalic sclerite. Reference to literature

called also daddy-long-legs, with round undivided bodies and
very long, easily-detached legs. The intromittent organs of the
male are remarkable for their complexity and elaboration. The
confluence of the regions of the body and the dislocation of apertures
from their typical position are results of degeneration. The Opiliones
seem to lead on from the Spiders to the Mites. Reference to literature

<p class="pt1">Apparently related to the Opiliones are two extinct groups, the
Anthracomarti and Phalangiotarbi, which are not known to have
survived the Carboniferous period. In the Anthracomarti the
opisthosoma was movably articulated to the prosoma, and consisted
of from eight to ten segments furnished with movable lateral plates,
the anal segment being overlapped dorsally by a laminate expansion
of the preceding segment. The carapace of the prosoma was
unsegmented and often bore a pair of eyes. The appendages of the
2nd pair were slender and pediform; those of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and
6th pairs were similar in form and ambulatory in function with
their basal segments arranged round a sternal area as in the order
Araneae. The best-known genera were <i>Anthracomartus</i> and
<i>Eophognus</i>.</p>

<p>In the Phalangiotarbi the appendages resembled those of the
Anthracomarti, except that the basal segments of the last four pairs
were usually approximated in the middle line leaving a long and
narrow sternal area between; and the carapace of the prosoma was
unsegmented. The prosoma and opisthosoma were broadly confluent
and probably immovably welded together. The opisthosoma
consisted of eight or nine segments, whereof the anterior five or six
were very short in the dorsal region, and the posterior three
exceptionally large with the anal orifice terminal.</p>

<p>Several genera have been established, the best-characterized
being <i>Geraphognus</i> and <i>Architarbus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Remarks on the Rhynchostomi.</i>&mdash;The Acari include a number of
forms which are of importance and special interest on account of
their parasitic habits. The ticks (<i>Ixodes</i>) are not only injurious
as blood-suckers, but are now credited with carrying the germs
of Texas cattle-fever, just as mosquitoes carry those of malaria.
The itch-insect (<i>Sarcoptes scabiei</i>) is a well-known human parasite,
so minute that it was not discovered until the end of the 18th century,
and &ldquo;the itch&rdquo; was treated medicinally as a rash. The female
burrows in the epidermis much as the female trap-door spider burrows
in turf in order to make a nest in which to rear her young. The male
does not burrow, but wanders freely on the surface of the skin.
<i>Demodex folliculorum</i> is also a common parasite of the sebaceous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>
glands of the skin of the face in man, and is frequent in the skin
of the dog. Many Acari are parasitic on marine and freshwater
molluscs, and others are found on the feathers of birds and the hair
of mammals. Others have a special faculty of consuming dry,
powdery vegetable and animal refuse, and are liable to multiply
in manufactured products of this nature, such as mouldy cheese.
A species of Acarus is recorded as infesting a store of powdered
strychnine and feeding on that drug, so poisonous to larger organisms.

<p><span class="bold">ARAD,<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Ó-Arad</span>, a town of Hungary, capital of the county
of the same name, 159 m. S.E. of Budapest by rail. Pop. (1900)
53,903. It is situated on the right bank of the river Maros, and
consists of the inner town and five suburbs. Arad is a modern-built
town, and contains many handsome private and public buildings,
including a cathedral. It is the seat of a Greek-Orthodox
bishop, and possesses a Greek-Orthodox theological seminary,
two training schools for teachers&mdash;one Hungarian, and the other
Rumanian&mdash;and a conservatoire for music. The town played
an important part in the Hungarian revolution of 1848-49,
and possesses a museum containing relics of this war of independence.
One of the public squares contains a martyrs&rsquo;
monument, erected in memory of the thirteen Hungarian
generals shot here on the 6th of October 1849, by order of the
Austrian general Haynau. It consists of a colossal figure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>312</span>
Hungary, with four allegorical groups, and medallions of the
executed generals. Arad is an important railway junction,
and has become the largest industrial and commercial centre
of south-eastern Hungary. Its principal industries are: distilling,
milling, machinery-making, leather-working and saw-milling.
A large trade is carried on in grain, flour, alcohol,
cattle and wood. Arad was a fortified place, and was captured
by the Turks during the wars of the 17th century, and kept by
them till the end of that century. The new fortress, built in
1763, although small, was formidable, and played a great role
during the Hungarian struggle for independence in 1849.
Bravely defended by the Austrian general Berger until the
1st of July 1849, it was then captured by the Hungarian rebels,
who made it their headquarters during the latter part of the
insurrection. It was from it that Kossuth issued his famous
proclamation (11th August 1849), and it was here that he handed
over the supreme military and civil power to Görgei. The
fortress was recaptured shortly after the surrender of Görgei
to the Russians at Világos. The fortress is now used as an
ammunition depot.</p>

<p>The town of Uj-Arad, <i>i.e.</i> New Arad (pop. 6124), situated on
the opposite bank of the Maros, is practically a suburb of Arad,
with which it is connected by a bridge. The town was founded
during the Turkish wars of the 17th century. The works erected
by the Turks for the capture of the fortress of Arad formed
the nucleus of the new town.</p>

<p>Világos, the town where the famous capitulation of Görgei
to the Russians took place on the 13th of August 1849, lies
21 m. by rail north-east of Arad.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARAGO, DOMINIQUE FRANÇOIS JEAN<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> (1786-1853), French
physicist, was born on the 26th of February 1786, at Estagel, a
small village near Perpignan, in the department of the eastern
Pyrenees. He was the eldest of four brothers. Jean (1788-1836)
emigrated to America and became a general in the Mexican
army. Jacques Étienne Victor (1799-1855) took part in L.C.
de S. de Freycinet&rsquo;s exploring voyage in the &ldquo;Uranie&rdquo; from
1817 to 1821, and on his return to France devoted himself to
journalism and the drama. The fourth brother, Étienne Vincent
(1802-1892), is said to have collaborated with H. de Balzac in the
<i>Héritière de Birague</i>, and from 1822 to 1847 wrote a great number
of light dramatic pieces, mostly in collaboration. A strong
republican, he was obliged to leave France in 1849, but returned
after the amnesty of 1859. In 1879 he was nominated director
of the Luxembourg museum.</p>

<p>Showing decided military tastes François Arago was sent to
the municipal college of Perpignan, where he began to study
mathematics in preparation for the entrance examination of
the polytechnic school. Within two years and a half he had
mastered all the subjects prescribed for examination, and a
great deal more, and, on going up for examination at Toulouse,
he astounded his examiner by his knowledge of Lagrange.
Towards the close of 1803 he entered the polytechnic school,
with the artillery service as the aim of his ambition, and in 1804,
through the advice and recommendation of S.D. Poisson, he
received the appointment of secretary to the Observatory of
Paris. He now became acquainted with Laplace, and through
his influence was commissioned, with J.B. Biot, to complete
the meridional measurements which had been begun by J.B.J.
Delambre, and interrupted since the death of P.F.A. Méchain
(1744-1804). The two left Paris in 1806 and began operations
among the mountains of Spain, but Biot returned to Paris
after they had determined the latitude of Formentera, the
southernmost point to which they were to carry the survey,
leaving Arago to make the geodetical connexion of Majorca
with Ivica and with Formentera.</p>

<p>The adventures and difficulties of the latter were now only
beginning. The political ferment caused by the entrance of
the French into Spain extended to these islands, and the ignorant
populace began to suspect that Arago&rsquo;s movements and his
blazing fires on the top of Mount Galatzo were telegraphic
signals to the invading army. Ultimately they became so infuriated
that he was obliged to cause himself to be incarcerated
in the fortress of Belver in June 1808. On the 28th of July he
managed to escape from the island in a fishing-boat, and after
an adventurous voyage he reached Algiers on the 3rd of August.
Thence he procured a passage in a vessel bound for Marseilles,
but on the 16th of August, just as the vessel was nearing Marseilles,
it fell into the hands of a Spanish corsair. With the rest
of the crew, Arago was taken to Rosas, and imprisoned first in
a windmill, and afterwards in the fortress of that seaport, until
the town fell into the hands of the French, when the prisoners
were transferred to Palamos. After fully three months&rsquo; imprisonment
they were released on the demand of the dey of Algiers,
and again set sail for Marseilles on the 28th of November, but
when within sight of their port they were driven back by a
northerly wind to Bougie on the coast of Africa. Transport
to Algiers by sea from this place would have occasioned a weary
stay of three months; Arago, therefore, set out for it by land
under conduct of a Mahommedan priest, and reached it on
Christmas day. After six months&rsquo; stay in Algiers he once again,
on the 21st of June 1809, set sail for Marseilles, where he had to
undergo a monotonous and inhospitable quarantine in the
lazaretto, before his difficulties were over. The first letter he
received, while in the lazaretto, was from A. von Humboldt;
and this was the origin of a connexion which, in Arago&rsquo;s words,
&ldquo;lasted over forty years without a single cloud ever having
troubled it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through all these vicissitudes Arago had succeeded in preserving
the records of his survey; and his first act on his return
home was to deposit them in the Bureau des Longitudes at
Paris. As a reward for his adventurous conduct in the cause
of science, he was in September 1809 elected a member of the
Academy of Sciences, in room of J.B.L. Lalande, at the remarkably
early age of twenty-three, and before the close of
the same year he was chosen by the council of the polytechnic
school to succeed G. Monge in the chair of analytical geometry.
About the same time he was named by the emperor one of the
astronomers of the Royal Observatory, which was accordingly
his residence till his death, and it was in this capacity that he
delivered his remarkably successful series of popular lectures
on astronomy, which were continued from 1812 to 1845.</p>

<p>In 1816, along with Gay-Lussac, he started the <i>Annales de
chimie et de physique</i>, and in 1818 or 1819 he proceeded along
with Biot to execute geodetic operations on the coasts of France,
England and Scotland. They measured the length of the
seconds-pendulum at Leith, and in Unst, one of the Shetland
isles, the results of the observations being published in 1821,
along with those made in Spain. Arago was elected a member
of the Board of Longitude immediately afterwards, and contributed
to each of its <i>Annuals</i>, for about twenty-two years,
important scientific notices on astronomy and meteorology
and occasionally on civil engineering, as well as interesting
memoirs of members of the Academy.</p>

<p>In 1830, Arago, who always professed liberal opinions of the
extreme republican type, was elected a member of the chamber
of deputies for the Lower Seine, and he employed his splendid
gifts of eloquence and scientific knowledge in all questions connected
with public education, the rewards of inventors, and the
encouragement of the mechanical and practical sciences. Many
of the most creditable national enterprises, dating from this
period, are due to his advocacy&mdash;such as the reward to L.J.M.
Daguerre for the invention of photography, the grant for
the publication of the works of P. Fermat and Laplace,
the acquisition of the museum of Cluny, the development
of railways and electric telegraphs, the improvement of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span>
navigation of the Seine, and the boring of the artesian wells at
Grenelle.</p>

<p>In the year 1830 also he was appointed director of the Observatory, and
as a member of the chamber of deputies he was able to obtain grants of
money for rebuilding it in part, and for the addition of magnificent
instruments. In the same year, too, he was chosen perpetual secretary of
the Academy of Sciences, in room of J.B.J. Fourier. Arago threw his
whole soul into its service, and by his faculty of making friends he
gained at once for it and for himself a world-wide reputation. As
perpetual secretary it fell to him to pronounce historical <i>éloges</i> on
deceased members; and for this duty his rapidity and facility of
thought, his happy piquancy of style, and his extensive knowledge
peculiarly adapted him.</p>

<p>In 1834 he again visited England, to attend the meeting of the British
Association at Edinburgh. From this time till 1848 he led a life of
comparative quiet&mdash;not the quiet of inactivity, however, for his
incessant labours within the Academy and the Observatory produced a
multitude of contributions to all departments of physical science,&mdash;but
on the fall of Louis Philippe he left his laboratory to join in forming
the provisional government. He was entrusted with the discharge of two
important functions, that had never before been united in one person,
viz. the ministry of war and of marine; and in the latter capacity he
effected some salutary reforms, such as the improvement of rations in
the navy and the abolition of flogging. He also abolished political
oaths of all kinds, and, against an array of moneyed interests,
succeeded in procuring the abolition of negro slavery in the French
colonies.</p>

<p>In the beginning of May 1852, when the government of Louis Napoleon
required an oath of allegiance from all its functionaries, Arago
peremptorily refused, and sent in his resignation of his post as
astronomer at the Bureau des Longitudes. This, however, the prince
president, to his credit, declined to accept, and made &ldquo;an exception in
favour of a <i>savant</i> whose works had thrown lustre on France, and whose
existence his government would regret to embitter.&rdquo; But the tenure of
office thus granted did not prove of long duration. Arago was now on his
death-bed, under a complication of diseases, induced, no doubt, by the
hardships and labours of his earlier years. In the summer of 1853 he was
advised by his physicians to try the effect of his native air, and he
accordingly set out for the eastern Pyrenees. But the change was
unavailing, and after a lingering illness, in which he suffered first
from diabetes, then from Bright&rsquo;s disease, complicated by dropsy, he
died in Paris on the 2nd of October 1853.</p>

<p>Arago&rsquo;s fame as an experimenter and discoverer rests mainly on his
contributions to magnetism and still more to optics. He found that a
magnetic needle, made to oscillate over nonferruginous surfaces, such as
water, glass, copper, &amp;c., falls more rapidly in the extent of its
oscillations according as it is more or less approached to the surface.
This discovery, which gained him the Copley medal of the Royal Society
in 1825, was followed by another, that a rotating plate of copper tends
to communicate its motion to a magnetic needle suspended over it
(&ldquo;magnetism of rotation&rdquo;). Arago is also fairly entitled to be regarded
as having proved the long-suspected connexion between the aurora
borealis and the variations of the magnetic elements.</p>

<p>In optics we owe to him not only important optical discoveries of his
own, but the credit of stimulating the genius of A.J. Fresnel, with
whose history, as well as with that of E.L. Malus and of Thomas Young,
this part of his life is closely interwoven. Shortly after the beginning
of the 19th century the labours of these three philosophers were shaping
the modern doctrine of the undulatory theory of light. Fresnel&rsquo;s
arguments in favour of that theory found little favour with Laplace,
Poisson and Biot, the champions of the emission theory; but they were
ardently espoused by Humboldt and by Arago, who had been appointed by
the Academy to report on the paper. This was the foundation of an
intimate friendship between Arago and Fresnel, and of a determination to
carry on together further researches in this subject, which led to the
enunciation of the fundamental laws of the polarization of light known
by their names (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Polarization</a></span>). As a result of this work Arago
constructed a <i>polariscope</i>, which he used for some interesting
observations on the polarization of the light of the sky. To him is also
due the discovery of the power of <i>rotatory polarization</i> exhibited by
quartz, and last of all, among his many contributions to the support of
the undulatory hypothesis, comes the <i>experimentum crucis</i> which he
proposed to carry out for comparing directly the velocity of light in
air and in water or glass. On the emission theory the velocity should be
accelerated by an increase of density in the medium; on the wave theory,
it should be retarded. In 1838 he communicated to the Academy the
details of his apparatus, which utilized the revolving mirrors employed
by Sir C. Wheatstone in 1835 for measuring the velocity of the electric
discharge; but owing to the great care required in the carrying out of
the project, and to the interruption to his labours caused by the
revolution of 1848, it was the spring of 1850 before he was ready to put
his idea to the test; and then his eyesight suddenly gave way. Before
his death, however, the retardation of light in denser media was
demonstrated by the experiments of H.L. Fizeau and J.B.L. Foucault,
which, with improvements in detail, were based on the plan proposed by
him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARAGON,<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Arragon</span> (in Span. <i>Aragón</i>), a captaincy-general, and
formerly a kingdom of Spain; bounded on the N. by the Pyrenees, which
separate it from France, on the E. by Catalonia and Valencia, S. by
Valencia, and W. by the two Castiles and Navarre. Pop. (1900) 912,711;
area, 18,294 sq. m. Aragon was divided in 1833 into the provinces of
Huesca, Teruel and Saragossa; an account of its modern condition is
therefore given under these names, which have not, however, superseded
the older designation in popular usage.</p>

<p>Aragon consists of a central plain, edged by mountain ranges. On the
south, east and west, these ranges, though wild and rugged, are of no
great elevation, but on the north the Pyrenees attain their greatest
altitude in the peaks of Aneto (11,168 ft.) and Monte Perdido (10,998
ft.)&mdash;also known as Las Tres Sorores, and, in French, as Mont Perdu. The
central pass over the Pyrenees is the Port de Canfranc, on the line
between Saragossa and Pau. Aragon is divided by the river Ebro (<i>q.v.</i>),
which flows through it in a south-easterly direction, into two nearly
equal parts, known as Trans-ibero and Cis-ibero. The Ebro is the
principal river, and receives from the north, in its passage through the
province, the Arba, the Gallego and the united waters of the Cinca,
Esera, Noguera Ribagorzana, Noguera Pallaresa and Segre&mdash;the last three
belonging to Catalonia. From the south it receives the Jalon and Jiloca
(or <i>Xalon</i> and <i>Xiloca</i>) and the Guadalope. The Imperial Canal of
Aragon, which was begun by the emperor Charles V. in 1529, but remained
unfinished for nearly two hundred years, extends from Tudela to El Burgo
de Ebro, a distance of 80 m.; it has a depth of 9 ft., and an average
breadth of 69, and is navigable for vessels of about 80 tons. The Royal
Canal of Tauste, which lies along the north side of the Ebro, was cut
for purposes of irrigation, and gives fertility to the district. Two
leagues north-north-east of Albarracin is the remarkable fountain called
Cella, 3700 ft. above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>314</span>
sea, which forms the source of the Jiloca; and between this river
and the Sierra Molina is an extensive lake called Gallocanta,
covering about 6000 acres. The climate is characterized by
extreme heat in the summer and cold in the winter; among the
mountains the snowfall is heavy, and thunderstorms are frequent,
but there is comparatively little rain.</p>

<p>Within a recent geological period, central Aragon was
undoubtedly submerged by the sea, and the parched chalky soil
remains saturated with salt, while many of the smaller streams
run brackish. As the mountains of Valencia and Catalonia
effectually bar out the fertilizing moisture of the sea-winds,
much of the province is a sheer wilderness, stony, ash-coloured,
scarred with dry watercourses, and destitute of any vegetation
except thin grass and heaths. In contrast with the splendid
fertility of Valencia or the south of France, the landscape of
this region, like the rest of central Spain, seems almost a continuation
of the north African desert area. There are, however,
extensive oak, pine and beech forests in the highlands, and many
beautiful oases in the deeply sunk valleys, and along the rivers,
especially beside the Ebro, which is, therefore, often called the
&ldquo;Nile of Aragon.&rdquo; In such oases the flora is exceedingly rich.
Wheat, maize, rice, oil, flax and hemp, of fine quality, are grown
in considerable quantities; as well as saffron, madder, liquorice,
sumach, and a variety of fruits. Merino wool is one of the chief
products.</p>

<p>In purity of race the Aragonese are probably equal to the
Castilians, to whom, rather than to the Catalans or Valencians,
they are also allied in character. The dress of the women is less
distinctive than that of the men, who wear a picturesque black
and white costume, with knee-breeches, a brilliantly coloured
sash, black hempen sandals, and a handkerchief wound round
the head.</p>

<p>Three counties&mdash;Sobrarbe, situated near the headwaters of
the Cinca, Aragon, to the west, and Ribagorza or Ribagorça,
to the east&mdash;are indicated by tradition and the earliest chronicles
as the cradle of the Aragonese monarchy. These districts were
never wholly subdued when the Moors overran the country
(711-713). Sobrarbe especially was for a time the headquarters
of the Christian defence in eastern Spain. About 1035,
Sancho III. the Great, ruler of the newly established kingdom
of Navarre, which included the three counties above mentioned,
bequeathed them to Gonzalez and Ramiro, his sons. Ramiro
soon rid himself of his rival, and welded Sobrarbe, Ribagorza
and Aragon into a single kingdom, which thenceforward grew
rapidly in size and power and shared with Castile the chief part
in the struggle against the Moors. The history of this period,
which was terminated by the union of Castile and Aragon under
Ferdinand and Isabella in 1479, is given, along with a full account
of the very interesting constitution of Aragon, under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spain</a></span>
(<i>q.v.</i>). At the height of its power under James I. (1213-1276),
the kingdom included Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearic Islands
and the considerable territory of Montpellier in France; while
Peter III. (1276-1285) added Sicily to his dominions.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARAGONITE,<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> one of the mineral forms of calcium carbonate
(CaCO<span class="su">3</span>), the other form being the more common mineral calcite.
It crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, and the crystals are
either prismatic or acicular in habit. Simple crystals are, however,
rare; twinning on the prism planes (<i>M</i> in the figures)
being a characteristic feature of the mineral (fig. 1). This
twinning is usually often repeated on the same plane (fig. 2),
and gives rise to striations on the terminal faces (<i>k</i>) of the
crystals; often, also, three crystals are twinned together on
two of the prism planes of one of them, producing an apparently
hexagonal prism. The mineral is colourless, white or yellowish,
transparent or translucent, has a vitreous lustre, and, in fact, is
not unlike calcite in general appearance. It may, however,
always be readily distinguished from calcite by the absence of
any marked cleavage, and by its greater hardness (H. = 3½ &minus; 4)
and specific gravity (2.93); further, it is optically biaxial, whilst
calcite is uniaxial. It is brittle and has a subconchoidal fracture;
on a fractured surface the lustre is decidedly resinous in character.</p>

<p>The mineral was first found, as reddish twinned crystals with
the form of six-sided prisms, at Molina in Aragon, Spain, where
it occurs with gypsum and
small crystals of ferruginous
quartz in a red clay. It is
from this locality that the
mineral takes its name,
which was originally spelt
arragonite. Fine groups of
crystals of the same habit
are found in the sulphur
deposits of Girgenti in
Sicily; also at Herrengrund
near Neusohl in
Hungary. At many other
localities the mineral takes the form of radiating groups of
acicular crystals, such as those from the haematite mines of
west Cumberland: beautiful feathery forms have been found
in a limestone cave in the Transvaal. Fibrous forms are also
common. A peculiar coralloidal variety known as <i>flosferri</i>
(&ldquo;flower of iron&rdquo;) consists of radially arranged fibres:
magnificent snow-white specimens of this variety have long
been known from the iron mines of Eisenetz in Styria. The
calcareous secretions of many groups of invertebrate animals
consist of aragonite (calcite is also common); pearls may be
specially cited as an example.</p>

<p>Aragonite is a member of the isomorphous group of minerals
comprising witherite (BaCO<span class="su">3</span>), strontianite (SrCO<span class="su">3</span>), cerussite
(PbCO<span class="su">3</span>) and bromlite ((Ba, Ca)CO<span class="su">3</span>); and crystals of aragonite
sometimes contain small amounts of strontium or lead. A
variety known as tarnowitzite, from Tarnowitz in Silesia,
contains about 5% of lead carbonate.</p>

<p>Aragonite is the more unstable of the two modifications of
calcium carbonate. A crystal of aragonite when heated becomes
converted into a granular aggregate of calcite individuals:
altered crystals of this kind (paramorphs) are not infrequently
met with in nature, whilst in fossil shells the original nacreous
layer of aragonite has invariably been altered to calcite. From
a solution of calcium carbonate in water containing carbon
dioxide crystals of calcite are deposited at the ordinary temperature,
but from a warm solution aragonite crystallizes
out. The thermal springs of Carlsbad deposit spherical
concretions of aragonite, forming masses known as pisolite or
<i>Sprudelstein</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARAGUA,<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> one of the smaller states of Venezuela under the
redivision of 1904, lying principally within the parallel ranges
of the Venezuelan Cordillera, and comprising some of the most
fertile and healthful valleys of the republic. It is bounded E.
by the Federal District and Maturin, S. by Guárico and W. by
Zamora and Carabobo. Pop. (1905, est.) 152,364. Aragua
has a short coast-line on the Caribbean west of the Federal
District, but has no port of consequence. Cattle, swine and goats
are raised, and the state produces coffee, sugar, cacao, beans,
cereals and cheese. The climate of the higher valleys is subtropical,
the mean annual temperature ranging from 74° to 80° F.
The capital, La Victoria (pop. 7800), is situated in the fertile
Aragua valley, 1558 ft. above sea-level and 36 m. south-west of
Carácas. Other important towns are Barbacoas (pop. 13,109) on

<p><span class="bold">ARAGUAYA,<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> <span class="sc">Araguay</span> or <span class="sc">Araguia</span>, a river of Brazil and
principal affluent of the Tocantins, rising in the Serra do Cayapó,
where it is known as the Rio Grande, and flowing in a north by
east direction to a junction with the Tocantins at Sao Joao do
Araguaya, or Sao Joao das Duas Barras. Its upper course forms
the boundary line between Goyaz and Matto Grosso. The river
divides into two branches at about 13° 20&prime; S. lat., and unites again
at 10° 30&prime;, forming the large island of Santa Anna or Bananal.
The eastern branch, called the Furo, is the one used by boats,
as the main channel is obstructed by rapids. Its principal
affluent is the Rio das Mortes, which rises in the Serra de Sao
Jeronymo, near Cuyabá, Matto Grosso, and is utilized by
boatmen going to Pará. Of other affluents, the Bonito, Garças,
Cristallino and Tapirapé on the west, and the Pitombas, Claro,
Vermelho, Tucupá and Chavante on the east, nothing definite is
known as the country is still largely unexplored. The Araguaya
has a course of 1080 m., considerable stretches of which are
navigable for small river steamers, but as the river below Santa
Anna Island is interrupted by reefs and rapids in two places&mdash;one
having a fall of 85 ft. in 18 m., and the other a fall of 50 ft.

<p><span class="bold">ARAKAN,<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> a division of Lower Burma. It consists of a strip
of country running along the eastern seaboard of the Bay of
Bengal, from the Naaf estuary, on the borders of Chittagong,
to Cape Negrais. Length from northern extremity to Cape
Negrais, about 400 m.; greatest breadth in the northern part,
90 m., gradually diminishing towards the south, as it is hemmed
in by the Arakan Yoma mountains, until, in the extreme south,
it tapers away to a narrow strip not more than 15 m. across.
The coast is studded with islands, the most important of which
are Cheduba, Ramree and Shahpura. The division has its headquarters
at Akyab and consists of four districts&mdash;namely, Akyab,
Northern Arakan Hill Tracts, Sandoway and Kyaukpyu,
formerly called Ramree. Its area is 18,540 sq. m. The population
at the time of the British occupation in 1826 did not exceed
100,000. In 1831 it amounted to 173,000; in 1839 to 248,000,
and in 1901 to 762,102.</p>

<p>The principal rivers of Arakan are&mdash;(1) the Naaf estuary, in
the north, which forms the boundary between the division and
Chittagong; (2) the Myu river, an arm of the sea, running a
course almost parallel with the coast for about 50 m.; (3) the
Koladaing river, rising near the Blue mountain, in the extreme
north-east, and falling into the Bay of Bengal a few miles south
of the Myu river, navigable by vessels of from 300 to 400 tons
burden for a distance of 40 m. inland; and (4) the Lemyu river,
a considerable stream falling into the bay a few miles south of
the Koladaing. Farther to the south, owing to the nearness
of the range which bounds Arakan on the east, the rivers are of
but little importance. These are the Talak and the Aeng,
navigable by boats; and the Sandoway, the Taungup and the
Gwa streams, the latter of which alone has any importance,
owing to its mouth forming a good port of call or haven for
vessels of from 9 to 10 ft. draught. There are several passes over
the Yoma mountains, the easiest being that called the Aeng
route, leading from the village of that name into Upper Burma.
The staple crop of the province is rice, along with cotton, tobacco,
sugar, hemp and indigo. The forests produce abundance of
excellent oak and teak timber.</p>

<p>The natives of Arakan trace their history as far back as
2666 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and give a lineal succession of 227 native princes down
to modern times. According to them, their empire had at one
period far wider limits, and extended over Ava, part of China,
and a portion of Bengal. This extension of their empire is not,
however, corroborated by known facts in history. At different
times the Moguls and Pegus carried their arms into the heart of
the country. The Portuguese, during the era of their greatness
in Asia, gained a temporary establishment in Arakan; but in
1782 the province was finally conquered by the Burmese, from
which period until its cession to the British in 1826, under the
treaty of Yandaboo, its history forms part of that of Burma.
The old city of Arakan, formerly the capital of the province, is
situated on an inferior branch of the Koladaing river. Its
remoteness from the ports and harbours of the country, combined
with the extreme unhealthiness of its situation, have led
to its gradual decay subsequently to the formation of the comparatively
recent settlement of Akyab, which place is now the
chief town of the province. The old city (now Myohaung) lies 50
m. north-east of Akyab. The Maghs, who form nearly the whole
population of the province, follow the Buddhist doctrines, which
are universally professed throughout Burma. The priests are
selected from all classes of men, and one of their chief employments
is the education of children. Instruction is consequently
widely diffused, and few persons, it is said, can be found in the
province who are unable to read. The qualifications for entering
into the priestly order are good conduct and a fair measure of
learning&mdash;such conduct at least as is good according to Buddhist
tenets, and such learning as is esteemed among their votaries.</p>

<p>The Arakanese are of Burmese origin, but separated from the
parent stock by the Arakan Yoma mountains, and they have
a dialect and customs of their own. Though conquered by the
Burmese, they have remained distinct from their conquerors.</p>

<p>The Northern Arakan Hill Tracts district is under a superintendent,
who is usually a police officer, with headquarters
at Paletwa. The area of the Hill Tracts is 5233 sq. m.; pop.
(1901) 20,682.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARAKCHEEV, ALEKSYEI ANDREEVICH,<a name="ar142" id="ar142"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count</span> (1769-1834),
Russian soldier and statesman, was descended from an
ancient family of Great Novgorod. From his mother, Elizabeth
Vitlitsaya, he inherited most of his characteristics, an insatiable
love of work, an almost pedantic love of order and the most
rigorous sense of duty. In 1788 he entered the corps of noble
cadets in the artillery and engineering department, where his
ability, especially in mathematics, soon attracted attention.
In July 1791 he was made an adjutant on the staff of Count
N.I. Saltuikov, who (September 1792) recommended him to
the cesarevich Paul Petrovich as the artillery officer most capable
of reorganizing the army corps maintained by the prince at
Gatchina. Arakcheev speedily won the entire confidence of
Paul by his scrupulous zeal and undeniable technical ability.
His inexorable discipline (magnified into cruelty by later legends)
soon made the Gatchina corps a model for the rest of the
Russian army. On the accession of Paul to the throne Arakcheev
was promptly summoned to St Petersburg, appointed
military commandant in the capital, and major-general in the
grenadier battalion of the Preobrazhenskoe Guard. On the
12th of December 1796, he received the ribbon of St Anne and
a rich estate at Gruzina in the government of Novgorod, the
only substantial gift ever accepted by him during the whole of
his career. At the coronation (5th of April 1797) Paul created
him a baron, and he was subsequently made quartermaster-general
and colonel of the whole Preobrazhenskoe Guard. It
was to Arakcheev that Paul entrusted the reorganization of the
army, which during the latter days of Catherine had fallen into
a state of disorder and demoralization. Arakcheev remorselessly
applied the iron Gatchina discipline to the whole of the imperial
forces, beginning with the Guards. He soon became generally
detested by the army, but pursued his course unflinchingly
and introduced many indispensable hygienic reforms. &ldquo;Clean
barracks are healthy barracks,&rdquo; was his motto. Nevertheless,
the opposition of the officers proved too strong for him, and on
the 18th of March 1798 he was dismissed from all his appointments.
Arakcheev&rsquo;s first disgrace only lasted six months. On
the 11th of August he was received back into favour, speedily
reinstated in all his former offices, and on the 5th of May 1799
was created a count, the emperor himself selecting the motto:
&ldquo;Devoted, not servile.&rdquo; Five months later he was again in
disgrace, the emperor dismissing him on the strength of a
denunciation subsequently proved to be false. It was a fatal
step on Paul&rsquo;s part, for everything goes to prove that he would
never have been assassinated had Arakcheev continued by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>
side. During the earlier years of Alexander, Arakcheev was
completely overlooked. Only on the 27th of April 1803, was
the count recalled to St Petersburg, and employed as inspector-general
of the artillery. His wise and thorough reorganization
of the whole department contributed essentially to the victories
of the Russians during the Napoleonic wars. All critics agree,
indeed, that the Arakcheev administration was the golden era
of the Russian artillery. The activity of the inexhaustible
inspector knew no bounds, and he neglected nothing which
could possibly improve this arm. His principal reforms were
the subdivision of the artillery divisions into separate independent
units, the formation of artillery brigades, the establishment
of a committee of instruction (1808), and the publishing
of an <i>Artillery Journal</i>. At Austerlitz he had the satisfaction
of witnessing the actual results of his artillery reforms. The
commissariat scandals which came to light after the peace of
Tilsit convinced the emperor that nothing short of the stern and
incorruptible energy of Arakcheev could reach the sources of
the evil, and in January 1808 he was appointed inspector-general
and war minister. When, on the outbreak of the Swedish war
of 1809, the emperor ordered the army to take advantage of an
unusually severe frost and cross the ice of the Gulf of Finland,
it was only the presence of Arakcheev that compelled an unwilling
general and a semi-mutinous army to begin a campaign
which ended in the conquest of Finland. On the institution of
the &ldquo;Imperial Council&rdquo; (1st of January 1810), Arakcheev was
made a member of the council of ministers and a senator, while
still retaining the war office. Subsequently Alexander was
alienated from him owing to the intrigues of the count&rsquo;s enemies,
who hated him for his severity and regarded him as a dangerous
reactionary. The alienation was not, however, for long. It is
true, Arakcheev took no active part in the war of 1812, but
all the correspondence and despatches relating to it passed
through his hands, and he was the emperor&rsquo;s inseparable companion
during the whole course of it. At Paris (31st of March
1814) Alexander, with his own hand, wrote the <i>ukaz</i> appointing
him a field-marshal, but he refused the dignity, accepting,
instead, a miniature portrait of his master. From this time
Alexander&rsquo;s confidence in Arakcheev steadily increased, and
the emperor imparted to him, first of all, his many projects of
reform, especially his project of military colonies, the carrying
out of the details of which was committed to Arakcheev (1824).
The failure of the scheme was due not to any fault of the count,
but to the inefficiency and insubordination of the district
officers. In Alexander&rsquo;s last years Arakcheev was not merely
his chief counsellor, but his dearest friend, to whom he submitted
all his projects for consideration and revision. The most interesting
of these projects was the plan for the emancipation of the
peasantry (1818). On the accession of Nicholas I., Arakcheev,
thoroughly broken in health, gradually restricted his immense
sphere of activity, and on the 26th of April 1826, resigned all his
offices and retired to Carlsbad. The 50,000 roubles presented
to him by the emperor as a parting gift he at once handed to
the Pavlovsk Institute for the education of the daughters of
poor gentlemen. His last days he spent on his estate at Gruzina,
carefully collecting all his memorials of Alexander, whose memory
he most piously cherished. He also set aside 25,000 roubles for
the author of the best biography of his imperial friend. Arakcheev
died on the 21st of April 1834, with his eyes fixed to the
last on the late emperor&rsquo;s portrait. &ldquo;I have now done everything,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;so I can go and make my report to the emperor
Alexander.&rdquo; In 1806 he had married Natalia Khomutova, but
they lived apart, and he had no children by her.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARAL,<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> a lake or inland sea in the west of Asia, situated
between lat. 43° 30&prime; and 46° 51&prime; N., and long. 58° 13&prime; and
61° 56&prime; E. It was known to the ancient Arab and Persian
geographers as the Sea of Khw&#257;rizm or Kharezm, from the neighbouring
district of the Chorasmians, and derives its present name
from the Kirghiz designation of Aral-denghiz, or Sea of Islands.
In virtue of its area (26,233 sq. m.) it is the fourth largest inland
sea of the world. It has nearly the same length as width,
namely about 170 m., if its northern gulf (Kichkineh-denghiz)
is left out of account. Its depth is insignificant, the maximum
being 220 ft. in a depression in the north-west, and the mean
depth only 50 ft., so that notwithstanding its area it contains
only eleven times as much water as the Lake of Geneva. Its
altitude is 242½ ft. above the Caspian, <i>i.e.</i> about 155 ft. above
the ocean. The lake is surrounded on the north by steppes; on
the west by the rocky plateau of Ust-Urt, which separates it from
the Caspian; on the south by the alluvial district of Khiva; and
on the east by the Kyzyl-kum, or Red Sand Desert. On the north
the shores are comparatively low, and the coast-line is broken by
a number of irregular bays, of which the most important are
those of Sary-chaganak and Paskevich. On the west an almost
unbroken wall of rock extends from Chernychev Bay southwards,
rising towards the middle to 500 ft. The southern coast
is occupied by the delta of the Oxus (J&#299;h&#363;n, Amu-darya), one
of the arms of which, the Laudan, forms a swamp, 80 m. long
and 20 broad, before it discharges into the sea. The only
other tributary of any size that the sea receives is the Jaxartes
(Sihun, Syr-darya) which enters towards the northern extremity
of the east coast, and is suspected to be shifting its embouchure
more and more to the north. This river, as well as the Amu,
conveys vast quantities of sediment into the lake; the delta
of the Syr-darya increased by 13¾ sq. m. between 1847 and 1900.
The eastern coast is fringed with multitudes of small islands,
and other islands, some of considerable size, are situated in the
open towards the north and west. Kug-Aral, the largest, lies
opposite the mouth of the Syr-darya, cutting off the Kichkineh-denghiz
or Little Sea. The next largest island is the Nikolai,
nearly in the middle. Navigation is dangerous owing to the
frequency and violence of the storms, and the almost total
absence of shelter. The north-east wind is the most prevalent,
and sometimes blows for months together. The only other
craft, except the steamships of the Russians, that venture on
the waters, are the flat-bottomed boats of the Kirghiz.</p>

<p>In regard to the period of the formation of the Aral there were
formerly two theories. According to Sir H.C. Rawlinson
(<i>Proc. Roy. Geog. Soc.</i>, March 1867) the disturbances which
produced the present lake took place in the course of the middle
ages; while Sir Roderick Murchison contended (<i>Journ. of Roy.
Geog. Soc.</i>, 1867, p. cxliv. &amp;c.) that the Caspian and Aral existed
as separate seas before and during all the historic period, and
that the main course of the rivers Jaxartes and Oxus was determined
in a prehistoric era. The former based his opinion largely
on historical evidence, and the latter trusted principally to
geological data. There is no doubt that in recent historical
times Lake Aral had a much greater extension than it has at the
present time, and that its area is now diminishing. This is, of
course, due to the excess of evaporation over the amount of
water supplied by its two feeders, the Amu-darya and the Syr-darya,
both of which are seriously drawn upon for irrigation in
all the oases they flow through. Old shore lines and other
indications point to the level of the lake having once been 50 ft.
above the existing level. Nevertheless the general desiccation
is subject to temporary fluctuations, which appear to correspond
to the periods recently suggested by Eduard Brückner
(b. 1862); for, whereas the lake diminished and shrank during
1850-1880, since the latter year it has been rising again. Islands
which were formerly connected with the shore are now some
distance away from it and entirely surrounded by water. Moreover,
on a graduated level, put down in 1874, there was a permanent
rise of nearly 4 ft. by 1901. The temperature at the
bottom was found (1900-1902) by Emil Berg to be 33.8° Fahr.,
while that of the surface varied from 44.5° to 80.5° between
May and September; the mean surface temperature for July
was 75°. The salinity of the water is much less than that of
the ocean, containing only 1.05% of salt, and the lake freezes
every year for a great distance from its shores. The opinion
that Lake Aral periodically disappeared, which was for a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>317</span>
time countenanced by Western geographers, loses more and
more probability now that it is evident that at a relatively
recent period the Caspian Sea extended much farther eastward
than it does now, and that Lake Aral communicated with it
through the Sary-kamysh depression. The present writer is
even inclined to think that, besides this southern communication
with the Caspian, Lake Aral may have been, even in historical
times, connected with the Mortvyi Kultuk (Tsarevich) Gulf of
the Caspian, discharging part of its water into that sea through
a depression of the Ust-Urt plateau, which is marked by a chain
of lakes (Chumyshty, Asmantai). In this case it might have
been easily confounded with a gulf of the Caspian (as by Jenkinson).
That the level of Lake Aral was much higher in post-Pliocene
times is proved by the discovery of shells of its characteristic
species of <i>Pecten</i> and <i>Mytilus</i> in the Kara-kum Desert,
33 m. south of the lake and at an altitude of 70 ft. above its
present level, and perhaps even up to 200 ft. (by Syevertsov).</p>

<p>The fish of Lake Aral belong to fresh-water species, and in
some of its rapid tributaries the interesting <i>Scaphirhynchus</i>,
which represents a survival from the Tertiary epoch, is found.
The fishing is very productive, the fish being exported to Turkestan,
Merv and Russia. The shores of the lake are uninhabited;
the nearest settlements are Kazala, 55 m. east, on the Syr, and
Chimbai and Kungrad in the delta of the Amu.</p>
